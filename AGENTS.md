# Agent Instructions

## Instruction Changes: Clarity Check
- Whenever you change narration or operational instructions, review the surrounding guidance for potential ambiguity, overlap, or contradiction introduced by the change.
- If any phrasing could be misunderstood (e.g., does it end a response vs. change ordering), revise the language in the same edit until the flow is unambiguous and consistent with related files.
