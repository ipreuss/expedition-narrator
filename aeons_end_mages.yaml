    the flooded ruins beneath Old Gravehold with Kadir and Claudia.  There he found
    an ancient necklace that allowed him to control water; he now uses it to fight
    the Nameless and search for further mysteries.
  appearance: A daring explorer depicted with water-themed attire and gear suited for
    underwater exploration.  He carries a mystical necklace that grants him power
    over water.
  strengths: 'His High Tide ability manipulates a surge track on his Ancient Breach:
    he may gain surge tokens or spend them to cast a spell from his Ancient Breach
    for extra harm and charge'
  weaknesses: Requires careful management of surge tokens; if he expends them too
    early he loses his burst potential
  story_notes: Gygar led an expedition into the sunken ruins of Old Gravehold and
    encountered the aquatic Nameless Fortress.  After its defeat he vowed to study
    how Nameless adapt to human environments.

  name: Lost
  background: Lost is an enigmatic forgemaster sealed in a massive suit of armor.

    to a slow start

      of her draw phase, accelerating her deck
    weaknesses: Drawing three extra cards can lead to a larger deck with less control

      hazards.  At the fountain of souls she helped destroy the source once its
      corruption was revealed.
- id: inco
  name: Inco
  background: Inco is a young breach mage attuned to the natural world, raised by
    wild spirits and later adopted by Talix.  Gentle and earnest, he can coax life
    from plants but loses control when fear or anger surges.  He believes the land’s
    survival is inseparable from his own.
  appearance: Portrayed as a lithe youth entwined with vines and budding flowers,
    his skin mottled with green patterns and his hair crowned with leaves.
  strengths: Inco’s connection to plants allows him to rapidly grow vines and blossoms,
    rejuvenate dying vegetation and cause thorny growths that entangle foes.  He can
    sense the health of the land and follows its guidance to track allies.
  weaknesses: His control over growth is tied to his emotions—panic or anger may trigger
    uncontrolled bursts that hinder allies.  In barren or corrupted environments his
    power weakens, and his urgency to save plants can lead him into danger.
  story_notes: During the Into the Wild expedition, Inco helped free Razra from a
    living vine prison and uncovered signs of betrayal in the grove.  He later revealed
    he was raised by a plant‑based Nameless and vowed to expose those who turned his
    kin against him while healing the land.

    her instincts even when it puts her at risk.
  appearance: Razra rides a sleek, armored beast whose luminous eyes mirror her own
    defiance.  Her braided hair and scarred forearms speak of battles fought, while
    her cloak is pinned with symbols of her family and of Rip.
  strengths: Razra’s courage and agility allow her to dart through dangerous terrain
    and strike quickly.  Together with Rip she can outmaneuver foes, track paths through
    wilderness and carry messages or supplies at incredible speed.  Her stubborn resolve
    and quick thinking often turn the tide in desperate situations.
  weaknesses: Her impulsive nature leads her to act before thinking, sometimes ignoring
    orders or failing to coordinate with allies.  She depends on Rip for balance and
    may falter if they are separated.  Razra’s need to prove herself can blind her
    to risks and drag her companions into unnecessary danger.
  story_notes: In Into the Wild, Razra rushed north to fight a blight, was trapped
    in a vine prison, and recovered a powerful artifact after her rescue.  She later
    uncovered evidence of a traitor smuggling relics and chased the saboteur with Rip
    before reporting the betrayal to the council.

  appearance: A broad‑shouldered young man with solemn eyes and tattoos symbolizing
    his lost Tether.

    copies of a chosen spell and adds them to her hand, then she may prep up to three

    game he is slower
  story_notes: A legendary mage of old Gravehold, Thraxir vanished into the Void

    focuses too much on curing her corruption rather than spending time with her,
    and she hopes he will understand that her time is short.  Solein knows more about
    corruption than almost anyone—he was researching it in Erythiza when the city was

    among those lost.  Through her tears she whispered, "Now Solein...all those poor

    things and save the world like the heroes of Old Gravehold legends.  She is

- id: kavoc
  name: Kavoc
  background: Kavoc is an ambitious scholar devoted to researching aether and breach
    magic.  He admires past mages like Antoni Lexive, Kiri Maesan, and Kwananya Ja'ar
    and strives to surpass their legacy.  At the University of Erythiza he was part of
    a group making fundamental breakthroughs in breach magic and extra-dimensional space,
    cross-referencing findings with scientists studying corruption origins.  He discovered
    that corruption particles, smaller than the eye can see, concentrate in corrupted areas.
    He suspects a professor conducted inadvisable experiments with these particles that
    went terribly wrong.  Sleep-deprived and passionate, he says, "My hands tremble...
    When I think about the implications of my research, my vision blurs with excitement!"
    He collaborates with Auren on machines that detect breach energy readings.
  appearance: A young man with curly hair, a wild expression, and sharp blue eyes.  He
    has the worn look of someone who spends sleepless nights in research, his eyes showing
    the intensity of academic obsession.

    Kavoc gains 3 knowledge markers.  His swap cards Brain Lance and Soulstone
    are stronger versions of his starters.

- id: lilly
  name: Lilly
  background: Lilly is the daughter of Inco and Razra.  Raised with Void creatures
    as companions, she developed an unusual bond with these beings.  Her father
    taught her to see the Nameless as individuals—"some good, some bad, some angry,
    some scared, some curious. Just like us."  She followed a Void creature through
    a portal to another reality.  In the Future expedition, she is found living alone
    in the wasteland near the Changeling Nest—one of the children "collected" by the
    Changeling who somehow escaped.  Despite her unsettling origins, she remains
    relentlessly cheerful, bouncing when she walks and calling Shoshana "big ears lady."
    She knows the True Void intimately and guides her companions through its darkness.
  appearance: A young woman with an affinity for Void creatures, her black hair pushed
    into a rough bun.  Her smile shows more teeth than it should, hinting at her
    transformation.  She moves with unnatural energy and cheer.
  strengths: Her Pack Tactics ability (4 charges) lets her retrieve minions from
    discard and prep spells, or deal 3 damage to a minion.  Her minions count as
    spells dealing damage based on nemesis tier (3/6/9).

- id: naftir
  name: Naftir
  background: Naftir is a descendant of Xaxos, a man corrupted by the Void.  He says,
    "Spending time in the Void changes a person. It twists them, deep down."  His
    great-grandmother grew up in the Void, and Naftir is "still paying the price even
    after all these years."  Though he has never entered the Void himself, he knows
    its dangers intimately through family stories and lore.  Pragmatic and cautious,
    he urges companions to think before rushing into the Void, even when someone they
    love has been taken.  In the Duskling Tower, he confronts Corruption's Core—a creature
    that bears his features, a dark reflection of his bloodline.  When they meet, Naftir's
    eyes glow blue as the corruption recognizes something of itself in him.
  appearance: Known as the Void Inheritor, his appearance hints at the corruption
    lurking in his bloodline.  His eyes carry the weight of ancestral darkness, and
    in moments of confrontation with void creatures, they glow an eerie blue.
  strengths: His Amplify ability (4 charges) places Link tokens on breaches or casts
    all prepped spells from a linked breach at once.  His Consuming Breach stacks
    spells and deals 3 bonus damage after the third.
  weaknesses: Complexity 5 requires careful token and breach management.

- id: rhys
  name: Rhys
  background: Rhys is a mage whose mother wished for a daughter with natural magical
    abilities.  Lacking these gifts, he developed artificial solutions, finding old
    blueprints from an inventor named Auren and modifying them.  Over time he
    implanted mechanical components—shoulders, chest, neck, hands—saying "I could
    not stop improving."  Grumpy and antisocial, he prefers fishing alone in the river
    to dealing with people.  "I hate people," he mutters, though he fights alongside
    his companions when danger strikes, even when it costs him injuries like the cut
    on his wrist from battle.  Beneath his gruff exterior lies unexpected depth—"We
    all have our own dark side," he observes, accepting moral complexity in others
    where some see only threat.
  appearance: Part human, part machine, part magic.  He has mechanical prosthetics
    on various body parts, making him a hybrid of biological and mechanical being.
    Often found knee-deep in the river with a fishing rod.
  strengths: His Loop Data ability (6 charges) lets him acquire up to two spells
    costing 5 or less and retrieve up to two spells from discard.  He can control
    up to 6 breaches.
  weaknesses: Complex breach management with up to 6 artificial breaches requires
    significant aether investment.

  name: Shoshana
  background: Shoshana comes from a family of Tethers from the swamp village Faen.
    A descendant of Tyreesia and Kiryra, she was initially forbidden from becoming
    a Tether by her grandmother who believed "love is a weakness."  Shoshana
    rejects this, saying "I do not believe love is a weakness."  She has enhanced
    senses—advanced auditory implants that let her detect approaching people from
    great distances.  Patient and observant, she often lies in the grass, sensing the
    world around her before springing into action.  Her tether bond to Harmony runs
    deep—when Harmony was pulled into the Void, Shoshana's guilt erupted into boiling
    rage.  "We can't just abandon her!" she snarled, her patience giving way to fierce
    protectiveness.
  appearance: A mage with characteristic tattoos symbolizing her role as a Tether,
    and subtle mechanical enhancements to her hearing.  Her design reflects her bond
    with her chosen ally and her heightened awareness.
  strengths: Her Redirect Flow ability (6 charges) lets her tethered ally take an
    extra turn after hers.  At game start she chooses an ally who receives a Tether
    token and replaces a starter card with Soul Facet.
  weaknesses: Dependent on her tethered ally; if they struggle, so does she.

    scholarly knowledge and practical combat experience.

    adds +1 damage per cast.
