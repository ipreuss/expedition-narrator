    background: Taqren is Z’hana’s son, marked by his father’s death in the Fall.
      He believes in protection above all else and followed his mother south to
      bring her back and keep others safe.
    appearance: A young man in a long cloak emblazoned with his family crest; he carries
      a broad shield and a set of clawed gauntlets, his eyes marked by exhaustion
      and determination.
    strengths: His Esoteric Amplifier ability heals three life to him or, if he is
      exhausted, heals three life to Gravehold.
    weaknesses: Taqren’s focus on healing and protection means he inflicts little
      direct harm; he struggles to balance loyalty to his family with duty to the
      wider community.
    story_notes: Taqren left New Gravehold to find Z’hana, helped defend Azer from a
      massive Nameless, and traveled through the Void with the Outcasts.  At the

- id: nook
  name: Nook
  background: Nook was once a normal breach mage, but his obsession with tapping the
    Void nearly destroyed him.  He constructed a miniature Void portal that almost
    consumed him; Indira rescued him and sealed the portal, leaving Nook with only
    one functional breach and a mystic sphere containing the Void.  Now he fights
    on despite memory loss.
  appearance: Depicted as a gaunt mage clutching a dark orb.
  strengths: His ability allows him to cast spells directly from his hand, compensating
    for his single breach

  name: Mazra
  background: Mazra is Razra’s studious sister.  From an early age she petitioned

    became the youngest breach mage at ten.  She joins the expedition hoping to become
    head of the council of elders.
  appearance: Shown as a young scholar with scrolls and an ornate staff.
  strengths: Mazra’s Research ability lets her destroy one of her unique Mazra cards
    to gain a higher‑requires version or return all her Mazra cards from the set aside
    to her hand

    effectively she falls behind

- id: qu
  name: Qu
  background: Qu is the daughter of Xaxos and was raised in the Void.  She feels torn
    between the darkness of the Void and the light of New Gravehold.  In her story
    she describes her longing to escape the Void’s crushing emptiness and her pledge
    not to let the Nameless claim the world.
  appearance: Depicted with dual‑colored robes representing her Builder and Destroyer
    forms.
  strengths: Qu switches between Builder and Destroyer forms
  weaknesses: Flipping forms at inopportune moments can hinder coordination

      acceptance for her divided nature.
    appearance: Wears dark robes embroidered with Void motifs, her eyes reflecting
      both determination and sadness.
    strengths: Her Combust Aether ability allows her to draw three cards at the end
      of her draw phase, accelerating her deck
    weaknesses: Drawing three extra cards can lead to a larger deck with less control
    story_notes: Qu rejoined Xaxos in the Void, guiding a group of mages through its
      hazards.  At the fountain of souls she helped destroy the source once its
      corruption was revealed.
- id: inco
  name: Inco
  background: Inco is a young breach mage attuned to the natural world, raised by
    wild spirits and later adopted by Talix.  Gentle and earnest, he can coax life
    from plants but loses control when fear or anger surges.  He believes the land’s
    survival is inseparable from his own.
  appearance: Portrayed as a lithe youth entwined with vines and budding flowers,
    his skin mottled with green patterns and his hair crowned with leaves.
  strengths: Inco’s connection to plants allows him to rapidly grow vines and blossoms,
    rejuvenate dying vegetation and cause thorny growths that entangle foes.  He can
    sense the health of the land and follows its guidance to track allies.
  weaknesses: His control over growth is tied to his emotions—panic or anger may trigger
    uncontrolled bursts that hinder allies.  In barren or corrupted environments his
    power weakens, and his urgency to save plants can lead him into danger.
  story_notes: During the Into the Wild expedition, Inco helped free Razra from a
    living vine prison and uncovered signs of betrayal in the grove.  He later revealed
    he was raised by a plant‑based Nameless and vowed to expose those who turned his
    kin against him while healing the land.

- id: razra
  name: Razra
  background: Razra is Mazra’s younger sister, fiercely independent and bonded to
    the metallic beast Rip.  Impulsive and brave, she rushes to act first and trusts
    her instincts even when it puts her at risk.
  appearance: Razra rides a sleek, armored beast whose luminous eyes mirror her own
    defiance.  Her braided hair and scarred forearms speak of battles fought, while
    her cloak is pinned with symbols of her family and of Rip.
  strengths: Razra’s courage and agility allow her to dart through dangerous terrain
    and strike quickly.  Together with Rip she can outmaneuver foes, track paths through
    wilderness and carry messages or supplies at incredible speed.  Her stubborn resolve
    and quick thinking often turn the tide in desperate situations.
  weaknesses: Her impulsive nature leads her to act before thinking, sometimes ignoring
    orders or failing to coordinate with allies.  She depends on Rip for balance and
    may falter if they are separated.  Razra’s need to prove herself can blind her
    to risks and drag her companions into unnecessary danger.
  story_notes: In Into the Wild, Razra rushed north to fight a blight, was trapped
    in a vine prison, and recovered a powerful artifact after her rescue.  She later
    uncovered evidence of a traitor smuggling relics and chased the saboteur with Rip
    before reporting the betrayal to the council.

  background: Cairna lost her legs when the tunnels leading to New Gravehold collapsed.  Trapped

    seeking a way back, drawing strength from her will to endure.
  appearance: A determined young woman with stone prosthetic legs created from cavern
    rubble.

    Portalborn attack, leaving Lucien like a tide without a source.  He now vows to
    rise again and fight for his people.
  appearance: A broad‑shouldered young man with solemn eyes and tattoos symbolizing
    his lost Tether.
  strengths: Lucien uses special Channel, Tide and Flood breaches that generate extra
    aether, destroy cards or add harm when spells are cast

  background: Reth is another mage from Azer who lost her Tether.  Unlike Lucien,
    she refuses to accept the notion that she must rely on anyone else.  She criticizes

    fights to prove that mages without Tethers can be just as powerful.
  appearance: A rebellious girl with short hair and a fierce gaze, wearing a cloak
    with plant motifs.
  strengths: Her Missing Half ability searches her deck and set aside pile for all
    copies of a chosen spell and adds them to her hand, then she may prep up to three
    of those spells at her special Unbound breach

  appearance: Depicted with vibrant tattoos, swirling aether around her hands.
  strengths: Ilya’s Life Embrace ability lets any ally cast all of their prepared
    spells without exhausting them, allowing a huge burst of harm or support
  weaknesses: Her ability provides no direct harm and depends entirely on allies having
    strong prepared spells
  story_notes: During the Outcasts expedition, Ilya maintained the aether bubble
    that allowed the group to breathe in the Void and warned of a dream‑eater before

    of Void power.
  strengths: Thraxir’s Nameless Siphon ability allows him to cast up to three spells
    (or four if he has all breaches open)
  weaknesses: He relies on having many open breaches to maximize harm; early in the
    game he is slower
  story_notes: A legendary mage of old Gravehold, Thraxir vanished into the Void
    and returned centuries later as the Knight of Shackles.  During the Outcasts
    expedition he confirmed the fountain of souls existed and urged the mages to
    destroy it rather than repeat his fate.

      and give it +3 harm (from Outcasts overview table)

      to unravel.

      and attempted to fuse himself with a spider Nameless.  He emerged from the

      past cowardice.  She admits that when Brama grew paranoid and banished Arachnos
