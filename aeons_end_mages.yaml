- id: adelheim
  name: Adelheim
  background: Adelheim is a weaponsmith who continues to work in the forge of Gravehold
    even after the world has fallen.  In his story he reflects on the folly of forging
    tools of war for a conflict that never seems to end, yet he refuses to stop because
    the city still needs weapons.  Adelheim has become a breach mage, using his craft
    to defend the last refuge of humanity.
  appearance: No official description of his physical appearance was found.
  strengths: As a support/utility mage Adelheim excels at protecting his companions
  weaknesses: Adelheim’s reliance on exhausting attacks means his power is reactive
    rather than offensive
  story_notes: 'Adelheim is practical and protective.  When unusual tracks appear,
    he advises the

    group on animal behavior, corrects misclassifications and stays behind to

    strengthen the city’s defences.  His concern for Gravehold’s safety defines his

    role and he often takes on background tasks to ensure others can venture forth.'

- id: brama
  name: Brama
  background: Brama is the elder of Gravehold.  When the world collapsed she ordered
    the cave mouth to be sealed and helped the survivors learn the sister‑words—the
    arcane language of breach magic.  In her recollection she promises that glory
    will return if her people remain faithful.
  appearance: An older woman and mentor figure; no specific details were provided.
  strengths: Brama is a healing mage
  weaknesses: Low direct harm output; she is primarily a support character
  story_notes: 'Brama is the elder stateswoman of Gravehold.  She authorises expeditions
    and

    offers wisdom and comfort upon the mages’ return.  Her calm authority is

    matched by a nurturing spirit—she brews drakma tea, offers counsel and

    emphasises rest and healing.  Brama respects the sanctity of memory and

    admonishes the mages to record their experiences before they fade.


    During the fall of Gravehold she rushes into burning streets alongside Mist to

    drag a wounded Xaxos to safety, then leaves him in anger to defend the city.

    She scolds him for seeking forbidden power and later orders novices to link

    arms and hold off swarms of lesser foes so the elder mages can confront the

    towering Nameless.  When the cavern collapses she leads survivors into the

    tunnels and declares that only through training and discipline will they serve

    the remnants of Gravehold.  Brama teaches that forgetting and letting go of

    attachments is as important as learning to wield aether, and she cautions

    mages not to become attached to breaches or the power they provide.  In the

    tunnels she trains young mages personally, reminding them that each is a link

    in a chain and that their unity protects the community.  Her leadership

    carries both stern rebuke for reckless acts and deep compassion for those who

    suffer.


    After the confrontation with Bladius she regrets sending the expedition out alone
    and insists on greater training for all mages.  Brama works alongside Mist to
    mentor the camp’s defenders, emphasising discipline and unity.  When Xaxos reappears
    claiming he can draw strength from the Nameless, she snaps at him and forbids
    such practices, reminding everyone to focus their own breaches and reject forbidden
    power.  She also encourages the party to venture to the surface when Mist reports
    that lesser foes have fled above, urging them to witness the unexpected greenery
    and prepare for whatever lies beyond the caves.


    Brama accompanies Mist on a scouting mission in search of other breach mages but
    is ambushed by the Fungal Mesh.  Its spores encase her and rob her of her mind,
    forcing Mist to flee for help.  After the party defeats the creature and frees
    her, Brama collapses from exhaustion and grief but expresses relief when she learns
    that Mist is safe.  Grateful for her rescue, she resumes training the camp, invites
    the protagonist to her tent each evening to pass on arcane knowledge, and encourages
    the mages to reach out to other survivor groups.  She listens to the ringing of
    Malastar’s forge and whispers with Mist about a strange fog, sending scouts to
    investigate new threats while promising to continue their training when her strength
    returns.


    Using the insights gained while under the control of the mind‑controlling fungus
    she devises a plan for battling a memory‑eating creature.  Brama travels with
    the protagonist to act as an anchor, fortifying their mental pathways and restoring
    memories the enemy tries to devour.  In their mind’s eye she glows with a soft
    yellow light that fills them with hope.  Together they destroy the creature’s
    mind from within and close its breach; however, the strain takes its toll.  When
    the fight is over she collapses with relief and later admits that some memories
    will never be fully restored.  Despite this loss she continues to mentor the mages,
    gathering them around her tent each night to teach arcane knowledge and preparing
    them for the looming return of the giant Nameless that once shattered their home.


    After the final battle against the whirling juggernaut she embraces each mage
    as the dust settles, tears in her eyes.  Brama expresses profound pride and gratitude,
    telling them that without their courage humanity would not have survived.  She
    acknowledges that everyone owes them a debt and encourages them to savour this
    fleeting moment of relief before turning their attention back to protecting New Gravehold.


    During the closing moments of the war she tries once more to reach the corrupted
    ally who stands between them and the last breach.  A bolt of energy strikes him
    and she cries out for him to renounce his power and return to them, but he screams
    that he will never be helpless again and refuses to listen.  As he lurches toward
    the breach she lunges to stop him alongside Malastar, only to watch in horror
    as a black tendril wraps around him and drags him into the Void.  That evening
    Brama lies awake pondering questions with no easy answers: where did the giant
    Nameless come from, what became of their companion in the darkness and will he
    ever return?  For now she lets herself rest in the rare warmth of the sun, determined
    to continue training the mages while accepting that some mysteries may never be
    solved.  She tells her students that time is like water—it flows through and around them and their lives are but drops of blood in a vast confluence—and she warns that the Gate Witch bends and breaks this flow.'

- id: mist
  name: Mist
  background: Mist admits that people think she is brave, like the legendary Thraxir,
    but she confesses she is terrified.  She fights not just for Gravehold but for
    a chance to live again.  Mist was made a Dagger Captain and taught the sister‑words;
    she would sacrifice everything for even a single moment of true life.
  appearance: No physical description; portrayed as a courageous yet frightened woman.
  strengths: Mist is a support mage
  weaknesses: Low innate harm and reliance on allies for full effectiveness
  story_notes: 'Mist is intuitive and vigilant.  She senses traps and unseen threats
    before

    others and gathers physical clues—blood, tracks, strange fluids—to guide

    decisions.  Mist moves quietly, trusts her instincts and seldom laughs; her

    experiences in the depths leave her with haunting dreams and a cautious

    disposition.  When light fails she relies on touch and memory to navigate.


    During the fall of Gravehold she confronts Xaxos for seeking more power and

    warns that his actions have doomed them.  She rushes into battle alongside

    Brama, deflects falling stones with a telekinetic field and shepherds

    survivors into the tunnels.  In the chaos she recognises the largest breach

    any mage has seen and names the approaching threat.  Later, while tending

    wounded companions in the tunnels, she scolds Xaxos for his folly and

    screams at him when he refuses to close the dark breach behind him.  Mist

    trains novices to work together, emphasising teamwork and self‑control, and

    warns them that attachments to breaches and power can corrupt.  Her stern

    presence is tempered by moments of empathy when she comforts those overcome

    by guilt.


    In the aftermath of the lieutenant Bladius’s attack she trains the survivors to
    defend the camp and helps them channel their burgeoning abilities.  Mist tracks
    the trails of fleeing lesser foes through the caves and leads the party to the
    surface, revealing a living world of trees, streams and birds that no mage had
    seen since the fall.  When Xaxos returns through a strange breach and boasts that
    he can harness Nameless breaches, Mist strikes him, calling him a coward and reminding
    him of his prior betrayal.  Later, she arrives with a band of survivors to finish
    the battle against a spawning horror and helps harvest the strange pods that will
    be forged into new tools.


    Mist returns from the surface carrying a smooth pale sphere.  She explains that
    the gem can silence lesser foes, freezing them momentarily, and she shares it
    with the camp’s defenders.  Later, she and Brama leave New Gravehold on a scouting
    mission to search for other survivors, leaving the protagonist in charge.  When
    Mist staggers back into camp covered in blood, she begs the mages not to blame
    Brama—she tells them that a mind‑controlling fungus ambushed them and encased
    Brama in spores.  She implores the party to free their general before she is lost
    forever.  After the mages defeat the Fungal Mesh and rescue Brama, Mist determines
    the locations of other survivor groups and establishes supply lines with them,
    trading resources and intelligence.  She and Brama continue to train the mages
    and instruct them in the use of new equipment crafted from harvested pods and
    encourage them to investigate strange fogs and new breaches.

    During the battle against a fog‑shrouded Nameless her voice is drowned by choking
    haze.  The survivors watch her silhouette vanish in the gloom, but she returns
    with soot‑blackened hands to help coordinate the evacuation and search for missing
    loved ones.  After the fog clears she continues to support Malastar’s instruction,
    shares warnings about the dangers of Nameless fogs and vapours, and implores the
    mages to trust in their own strength rather than drawing on enemy power.  Later,
    when a memory‑eating creature threatens to erase minds, Mist helps rescue those
    overwhelmed and joins Brama in finishing off the foe after the protagonist collapses,
    ensuring the ore it guarded is retrieved for Malastar’s craft.


    After the hulking enemy collapses she approaches the protagonist, noting the sadness
    in their eyes as they look upon the devastated battlefield and think of all that
    has been lost.  Mist praises the mages for taking on the responsibility of protecting
    their people and offers one final instruction: listen to the power growing inside
    and embrace it to become stronger.  She teaches that by focusing internal aether
    they can reduce the requires of their abilities or enhance the harm of their spells,
    marking this as the last lesson before they face their final trial.


    In the aftermath of the final battle she sees the fallen form of the corrupted
    ally lying smouldering on the ground.  Overcome with grief and rage, Mist incinerates
    a nearby boulder and storms across the battlefield, demanding to know what has
    become of him.  When he rises again, burned and scarred, she dodges bolts of shadow
    and hurls flames, calling out “What happened to you?” even as he lashes out and
    disintegrates the earth beneath her feet.  After a dark tendril snakes from the
    breach and pulls him into the Void she helps channel magic to close it, but her
    mind is still racing.  As sunlight warms her face for the first time in months
    she sits quietly, feeling both relief and unease.  Questions linger: where did
    the giant Nameless come from and what fate awaits their former friend in the darkness?  She
    vows to remain vigilant even as she allows herself to enjoy the breeze and the
    warmth of the sun.'

  name: Xaxos
  background: Xaxos believes there is knowledge to gain from the Nameless.  He discerns
    a road to salvation others fail to see and plans to study the Nameless closely,
    even using their dark powers if necessary, to lift them from torment.
  appearance: Typically shown as a hooded scholar; no textual description was found.
  strengths: Xaxos is a support mage who helps others charge their abilities and manipulate
    the sequence of actions
  weaknesses: He inflicts little harm himself and depends on allies to make use of
    extra opportunities
  story_notes: 'Xaxos is thoughtful and inquisitive.  He sees beauty in the darkness
    and

    wonders aloud about the builders of the tunnels and the nature of the

    creatures they encounter.  Xaxos carries gemlight and often illuminates

    philosophical questions while others focus on survival.  His dreams reveal

    anxieties about becoming a nameless worker, hinting at deeper fears beneath

    his calm exterior.


    When a towering Nameless appears above Gravehold, Xaxos is injured and

    dragged back to the barracks by Brama and Mist.  He confesses that he

    attempted to harness more aether to protect the city but did not understand

    the consequences.  As the breach he opened spirals out of control and blades

    rain down, Xaxos realises his mistake and is wracked with guilt.  He hears

    Mist and Brama blame him for the catastrophe and begs forgiveness, but as

    the cavern collapses a dark breach opens behind him.  Ordered to close it,

    he hesitates and is pulled into the void, vanishing with an apology.  His

    actions haunt the survivors, serving as a cautionary tale about ambition and

    the corruption of power.  In later tales his symbols appear carved in the

    wilderness as cultists invoke his legacy, complicating his place in memory.


    Years later Xaxos emerges from a strange breach, healed and stronger.  He boasts
    that he can tap the Nameless’s breaches to save Gravehold, but Mist strikes him
    and Brama rebukes him, calling him a coward and reminding him of his past betrayal.  Xaxos
    pleads for another chance and insists that drawing on forbidden power is necessary
    to win the war, yet no one supports him and he sulks away, disappearing once more
    into the void.  His brief return further divides his former companions and foreshadows
    the threat he will become.


    When a twisted breach opens near the camp he rushes out of the void in a panic,
    warning of a nameless fog that consumes the unprepared.  He laments that the mages
    should have studied the enemy’s breaches and taken their power, but his words
    are cut off as the choking haze surrounds them.  In the chaos he strikes down
    the shadowy figure at the fog’s heart, saving the protagonist as tendrils close
    around them.  Even as the survivors close the breach he begs their leader to channel
    a Nameless breach and seize its energy, arguing that they will need such power
    when the giant Nameless returns.  She refuses, chastising him for repeating his
    mistakes.  A burst of raw energy knocks everyone to the ground and when they rise
    Xaxos has vanished again, leaving behind a lingering sense that he has tapped
    into something dangerous and will not give up his quest.

    At the end of the war he returns one last time, emerging from the darkness as
    the mages prepare to close the final breach.  Wild‑eyed and wreathed in tendrils
    of shadow, he accuses them of meddling and proclaims that he brought the giant
    Nameless to steal its power.  He confesses to drinking from the same well as the
    Nameless and declares that he will die before he lets them close the breach.  Hurling
    bolts of shadow and opening swirling breaches around him, he summons waves of
    lesser foes and forces his former companions to fight him.  Reasoning fails; consumed
    by the Void, he becomes the ultimate nemesis they must overcome to safeguard New Gravehold.


    Though the mages defeat his onslaught and leave him burned and broken, Xaxos does
    not yield.  As they move to seal the breach he pushes himself to his feet, cracks
    of electricity dancing across his scarred body.  Brama begs him to renounce his
    power and return, but he screams that he will never be helpless again.  He reaches
    toward the swirling void and is struck by a bolt of energy.  A long black tendril
    emerges from the breach, wraps around his mouth and lifts him into the air.  The
    last glimpse his former friends have of him is the terror on his face as the tendril
    pulls him into the darkness.  Sunlight streams through the closing breach, warming
    their faces, but questions haunt them: what happened to Xaxos in the Void, and
    will he one day return?  His fate remains unanswered, leaving only legends and
    uneasy dreams.'

- id: malastar
  name: Malastar
  background: As the breach‑mage mentor of Gravehold, Malastar trains the children
    who will become mages.  In his story he explains that he can always tell which
    younglings carry the spark—usually girls but sometimes boys—and laments that teaching
    them is his sad calling because many perish.  Apprentices first learn the sister‑words
    and then fashion their own gem.  Kadir leads them deep into the caves where they
    must find their way back, and finally they must slay a hungry creature from the
    void to earn their place.
  appearance: An older mentor with a patient demeanor; no specific physical details
    provided.
  strengths: Malastar is both supportive and offensive
  weaknesses: Limited breach slots restrict his early-game flexibility
  story_notes: 'Malastar is the patient mentor of Gravehold who guides young apprentices
    in the

    sister‑words and the forging of gems.  When old Gravehold is attacked he

    stands beside Dezmodia on the front line, holding off waves of lesser foes while

    novices escort civilians through the burning streets and collapsing halls.

    In the aftermath he tends to the wounded alongside Mist and helps Brama

    organise the evacuation into the tunnels.  There he resumes his role as

    teacher, instructing survivors and new mages in controlled spellcasting even

    amid grief.  Malastar reminds his students that breaches are tools to be

    respected, not indulged, and stresses that forgetting the intoxicating rush

    of power is key to preserving their humanity.


    During the rebuilding he assigns each mage a task and instructs the protagonist
    to defend the camp, resuming his lectures until Xaxos’s dramatic return interrupts
    him.  Malastar dismisses Xaxos’s tirades and focuses on equipping the mages: he
    directs them to a breeding ground where pulsating pods can be harvested and forged
    into powerful equipment and reaffirms that there is still a war to win.  After
    the breach is closed he oversees the collection of pods and promises to craft
    them into tools for the community.


    After the pods are harvested Malastar spends days in his forge crafting them into
    equipment tailored to each mage’s needs.  He personally instructs the party in
    the use of these tools and then returns to his work.  When Mist and Brama depart
    on a scouting mission he continues training the novices until news arrives of
    their ambush by a mind‑controlling Nameless.  During the battle against Fungal Mesh
    he closes the breach after the creature is defeated, standing over the fallen
    Nameless with his hands outstretched as energy from the other side calls to the
    mages.  Later he helps carry Mist back to her cabin and watches over her while
    the party rescues Brama.  In the aftermath Malastar guides the mages in choosing
    specializations, instructing them to focus their spells or increase their aether
    capacity, and he forges new configurations for their breaches and starting hands.


    When a choking fog descends on the camp he remains practical, covering his mouth
    and urging the mages to focus on evacuating civilians and coordinating the defence.  He
    continues teaching even as Brama and a reckless mage argue over whether to harness
    enemy breaches, reminding his students that channeling nameless power is forbidden.  Once
    the fog dissipates he returns to his forge, ready to craft equipment from the
    newly recovered pods and a strange ore discovered on the surface.  When scouts
    report that a memory‑devouring creature guards this ore, he supports Brama’s plan
    to anchor the mages’ minds and waits at the forge, prepared to imbue his tools
    with its raw power once the ore is secured.  Throughout these crises he never
    ceases to instruct, forging and innovating to ensure the community is prepared
    for the looming return of the colossal Nameless.


    In the final confrontation he rushes forward as the corrupted ally attempts to
    draw from the breach, lunging to stop him from seizing its power.  His effort
    comes too late; tendrils of darkness wrap around the traitor and drag him into
    the Void.  The mentor watches as questions take root in his students’ faces: where
    did the giant Nameless come from, and what destiny awaits their lost friend?  Malastar
    returns to his forge with these doubts in mind.  In quiet moments he contemplates
    unanswered mysteries but reminds the mages that vigilance, knowledge and preparation
    are their greatest weapons.  Some answers may remain beyond reach, yet they must
    continue to hone their abilities to safeguard what remains of their world.'

- id: nym
  name: Nym
  background: Nym is a unique breach‑mage from The Depths expansion.  Unlike most
    mages he does not inflicts harm directly; instead he tries to end the fight by
    emptying the nemesis deck.  The wiki notes that Nym pushes the game toward the
    secondary win condition by using his ability Terminus Barrier to set aside the
    top card of the nemesis deck—exhausting an extra card if the first is an attack.  This
    strategy forces players to pay attention to how many nemesis cards remain so they
    can decide whether to go for the kill or mill the nemesis deck.
  appearance: Not described; he is depicted as a young man holding a glowing disc.
  strengths: Nym excels at thinning the nemesis deck
  weaknesses: Nym inflicts no direct harm and relies entirely on his ability to mill
    the nemesis deck

  background: Reeve is an elite breach‑mage who specializes in dispatching lesser

    that she is an offensive mage dedicated to killing nemesis lesser foes quickly.  She
    carries a formidable sword and uses it with ruthless efficiency.
  appearance: Depicted as a warrior with short hair and a large sword.
  strengths: Reeve’s ability Quelling Blade requires four charges and inflicts five
    harm to one lesser foes and three harm to a different lesser foes
  weaknesses: Reeve’s strength lies in killing lesser foes; she has less impact when
    the nemesis deck contains few lesser foes

  name: Z'hana
  background: Z’hana is a renegade healer from The Depths expansion.  Her overview
    describes her as a defensive mage who can restore Gravehold’s life by tapping
    into sanctified glyphs.  Her unique spell Eternal Ember lets her double‑cast a
    prepared spell—once from the Ember and once normally—giving her offensive reach
    in addition to healing.  She starts with no open breaches but has the economy
    to focus them quickly and can have her level 4 breach open by the end of her first
    turn.
  appearance: Shown wearing desert robes and carrying an ornate staff.
  strengths: Z’hana’s Sanctum Glyph ability requires five charges and heals Gravehold
    for seven life—one of the largest single sources of healing in the game
  weaknesses: She begins the game with no breaches open, which slows her early spell
    casting

    background: In Outcasts Z’hana has abandoned New Gravehold and found a new way
      of life far to the south, though detailed narratives are not available.  She
      uses Glyph Carver tokens to heal Gravehold and empower supply cards.
    appearance: A weathered woman in crimson and brown robes, her hands and forearms
      marked with glyph tattoos; she carries a carved staff and exudes a commanding
      presence.
    strengths: In the Outcasts expedition she channels glyph magic to heal allies
      and empower supply cards, combining maternal instincts with tactical acumen.
    weaknesses: Her drive to atone makes her stubborn; she sometimes overextends her
      resources in an effort to protect everyone.
    story_notes: 'Z’hana abandoned New Gravehold after the council ignored her pleas
      for change and fled south to forge her own community.  As she built a rebellion
      she lamented the old traditions that sacrificed new ideas for safety.  When
      a monstrous Portalborn threatened the village of Azer she put aside her resentment
      and fought alongside her son and two Azerian Tethers.  During the battle she
      was reunited with Xaxos, who claimed he had learned from his mistakes and begged
      to help.  Despite her deep distrust, she reluctantly accepted his guidance after
      he saved her son’s life, determined not to ignore any chance to atone for her
      past.  Z’hana followed Xaxos through a breach into the Void, where poisonous
      air and haunting landscapes tested her resolve.  She fought through skeletal
      armies and confronted a legendary Knight of Shackles before reaching a pool
      of pure aether known as the fountain of souls.  Hoping to reclaim those she
      had lost in the Fall, Z’hana was devastated to discover that the fountain transformed
      souls into Nameless rather than restoring them.  She helped destroy the fountain
      and returned with a grim understanding: reconciliation with New Gravehold required
      bridging the Void and their world rather than clinging to either.  Her journey
      tempered her rebellion into a call for reform and healing.'
- id: dezmodia
  name: Dezmodia
  background: Dezmodia is a voidborn prodigy whose magic allows her to reshape other
    mages’ breaches.  There is little narrative text about her origins, but the overview
    calls her a supportive mage who can upgrade allies’ low‑level breaches into powerful
    sigil breaches.  Her unique card Oblivion Shard helps her gain higher‑valued gems
    or charge her ability quickly.
  appearance: Depicted as a young woman with bright white hair and void‑touched eyes.
  strengths: Dezmodia’s Tempest Sigil ability (six charges) destroys any player’s
    opened level I or II breach and replaces it with a sigil breach that adds +2 harm
    when casting spells
  weaknesses: She requires a large amount of aether to open her own breaches, and
    her ability has a high charge requires, making her slow to start
  story_notes: 'Dezmodia is thoughtlessly kind and fiercely protective of those who
    are shunned.

    She often leaps into danger to defend people who once spurned her, revealing a

    generosity that borders on self‑sacrifice.  Among her companions she is the youngest

    and most daring, unafraid to ask hard questions or challenge elders.  She delights
    in

    small moments of humour and connection, even when the world twists around her.

    Her boldness and empathy make her a catalyst for action and a moral compass when

    difficult choices arise, and her loyalty to her found family keeps her moving
    through

    the endless dark.

    During the fall of Gravehold Dezmodia faces down a monstrous Nameless that

    eclipses the sky.  While others evacuate civilians she stands as a single

    point of light against swirling darkness, holding back the foe’s lesser foes and

    buying precious time.  When the cavern shakes and towers collapse she

    unleashes her power in a final explosion, burying both herself and the

    Nameless beneath rubble.  Her sacrifice allows many to escape, and her

    absence haunts the survivors.  Tales of her courage remind mages that

    compassion and bravery often demand the ultimate price.'

    appearance: A pale mage with flowing silver hair and piercing eyes, wrapped in

    strengths: Her Swirling Darkness ability lets her draw cards and exchange cards

    prior to meeting Yan is lost.  Though not a natural mage, Yan trained him and
    he now uses breach magic to defend Gravehold.
  appearance: A massive warrior with crystal spikes on his body; he carries the relic
    Torch.
  strengths: Garu’s unique relic Torch allows him to focus any player’s breaches easily,
    accelerating the group’s setup
  weaknesses: Garu’s harm spike requires exhausting his prepared spells, which slows
    future turns
  story_notes: 'Garu is a mountain of muscle and loyalty.  His first instinct is to
    protect—

    whether catching a falling apple frozen in time or throwing himself at a shadow
    in

    the dark, he tries to shield his companions from harm.  He is quick to anger when
    he

    feels betrayed and just as quick to forgive, speaking plainly and acting decisively.

    His strength allows him to endure physical punishments others cannot, and his
    humour

    occasionally cracks through his stern exterior.  In the surreal reaches of the
    Void

    he remains grounded, using his body to anchor the group when time stretches and

    compassion to remind them why they fight.'

    prophets and augurs.  Mazahaedron believes the world is a massive living organism
    and that the survivors dwell within its sacred heart.  Out of reverence he levitates
    continuously and refuses to let his feet touch the ground.
  appearance: A levitating mystic clothed in prayer robes, always hovering above the
    earth.
  strengths: Mazahaedron is a supportive mage
  weaknesses: Focuses on support and economy rather than harm
  story_notes: 'Mazahaedron serves as the group’s spiritual anchor.  He senses the

  story_notes: 'Quilius is the youngest of the War Eternal band, sharp‑witted and

    supply regardless of requires.  If she has four opened breaches, an ally may also
    gain any card. She starts with three breaches in the furthest closed position
    and must invest heavily to open them.  Her unique spell Illuminate inflicts harm
    over time as she focuses breaches.
  appearance: Depicted as a regal woman with intricate tattoos and a flowing gown.
  strengths: Imperium Ritual (five charges) lets her acquire the most expensive cards
    immediately
  weaknesses: Yan Magda’s breaches start in the most closed orientation, slowing her
    early game
  story_notes: |
    Once an exile and now a leader, Yan Magda carries the weight of past decisions and unfulfilled promises.
    She guides a band of outcasts into unknown places, driven by the voices of those she fears she has lost.
    Yan is calm in crisis and unwavering in her moral code.  She demands honesty and accepts blame when things go wrong,
    trusting her companions to confront her mistakes.  Her quiet determination, sense of duty and capacity for forgiveness
    bind the group together, even when time stretches and guilt gnaws at them.
    In landscapes where memory and reality blur, Yan keeps them focused on their shared purpose—to bring the lost home and protect their people.
    On her journeys through the Void she glimpses the Gate Witch, describing it as the ragged face of the infinite and warning that time itself bends to the Witch’s will.

  strengths: 'His High Tide ability manipulates a surge track on his Ancient Breach:
    he may gain surge tokens or spend them to cast a spell from his Ancient Breach
    for extra harm and charge'
  weaknesses: Requires careful management of surge tokens; if he expends them too
    early he loses his burst potential
  story_notes: |
    Gygar is fascinated by the relics and ruins beneath Old Gravehold.  He proposed an expedition into the sunken city expecting to uncover magical artefacts or even treasure.  Instead he encountered Fortress, a giant aquatic Nameless that had built an almost impenetrable shell from the stones of their collapsed homes.  From above it appeared as nothing more than wreckage; only when the party approached did the rubble rise and reveal the creature beneath.  Gygar recognised that understanding how such beings adapt to and incorporate human environments could yield invaluable insights.  He vowed to study the Fortress after it was defeated to learn how the Nameless integrate themselves into the world.

  background: 'Lost is an enigmatic forgemaster discovered sealed within a massive
    suit of

    armour in an underground bunker.  He recalls little of his past beyond a

    far‑away “coffin home” and speaks in broken sentences, as if his mind has

    been damaged by decades of isolation.  Despite his imposing form and the

    flames that spill from the joints of his armour, Lost is gentle and

    welcoming.  He introduces the party to his squirrel‑like companion Meek and

    helps them gather the powerful artefacts scattered around his forge.  His

    existence proves that some mages can survive long periods cut off from

    Gravehold, though the requires may be their memories.'
  appearance: A towering suit of scorched metal armour with tongues of flame escaping
    its seams; his eyes glow softly through the visor and a small furry creature perches
    on his shoulder.
  strengths: Known as a master forgemaster, Lost crafts and maintains ancient weapons
    and armour for his allies.  He and Meek handle tools with ease and radiate warmth
    and resilience.
  weaknesses: Lost’s memory and identity are fractured; he struggles to recall who
    he was and may grow confused without gentle guidance.
  story_notes: 'Lost is not a conventional battle mage.  He is a survivor whose long

    isolation within a hidden forge has left him fractured but kind.  When

    confronted, he responds with warmth and curiosity rather than hostility.  He

    speaks slowly and sometimes repeats himself, suggesting difficulty

    organising his thoughts.  His bond with the small animal Meek hints at the

    importance of companionship in the face of solitude.  Lost exemplifies

    themes of memory loss, resilience and the rediscovery of forgotten allies.'

  appearance: A woman with crystalline hair and a calm demeanor.
  strengths: Rhia’s Sublimate ability allows her to return a card she purchased to

  weaknesses: Requires a supply rich in relics; she may struggle if few relics are

    Nameless remains to prevent corruption of the land and scowls at those who underestimate
    the danger, though she can be persuaded to stay her torch long enough to examine

  strengths: His Energize tokens can be placed on any player’s breaches and later

  weaknesses: He needs to generate Energize tokens before he can support others, leading

  story_notes: Soskel is a decorated expedition commander entrusted with the defence
    of New Gravehold.  He leads missions into the wilderness to recover missing colleagues
    and rare relics, mourning every fallen comrade along the way.  In the field he
    pauses to perform improvised rites for the dead, pressing his forehead to cold
    stone or grasping a fallen weapon as tears and curses spill from his mouth.  When
    a dark artefact pulses with Nameless energy he does not flinch, choosing to wield
    it as a tool to honour his promises rather than a temptation to corrupt.  Soskel
    remains haunted by the memory of Dezmodia’s sacrifice and the betrayal of would‑be
    saviours; he worries that his own desperate choices might turn him into a monster.  Even
    so, he vows to bring every lost mage home to their family.  He volunteers to guide
    survivors like Lost back to the city and to report to the elders, knowing that
    the duty of a breach mage never ends and that rest is brief at best.

      mother vanished to the south and was branded a traitor, Taqren did not believe
      she was evil; he chose to follow her and convince her to atone for her mistakes
      while continuing to shield their people.
    appearance: A young man in a long cloak emblazoned with his family crest; he carries
      a broad shield and a set of clawed gauntlets, his eyes marked by exhaustion
      and determination.
    strengths: His Esoteric Amplifier ability heals three life to him or, if he is

    weaknesses: Taqren’s focus on healing and protection means he inflicts little

    story_notes: Taqren left the safety of New Gravehold to search for his mother
      and to end the suffering caused by her rebellion.  A calm and steadfast mage,
      he uses shimmering shields and clawed gloves both to protect civilians and to
      fight.  In the remote village of Azer he helped repel an enormous Nameless with
      long tendrils, standing shoulder to shoulder with unfamiliar Azerian mages.  When
      Xaxos appeared, scarred and repentant, Taqren argued for mercy even as he blamed
      the man for his father’s death.  He travelled through the Void with Z’hana,
      Kel, Ilya and Xaxos, learning to breathe the tainted air and focusing on his
      task despite nausea and headaches.  Throughout the expedition he reminded his
      mother of their duty to the living, even when hope of restoring the dead tempted
      her.  At the fountain of souls he lashed out at Xaxos when he learned the truth
      but ultimately helped channel aether to destroy the pool.  The journey hardened
      Taqren’s resolve; he now believes true healing comes from facing painful truths
      rather than clinging to impossible dreams.

    Void nearly destroyed him.  He constructed a miniature Void portal that almost
    consumed him; Indira rescued him and sealed the portal, leaving Nook with only
    one functional breach and a mystic sphere containing the Void.  Now he fights
    on despite memory loss.
  appearance: Depicted as a gaunt mage clutching a dark orb.
  strengths: His ability allows him to cast spells directly from his hand, compensating
    for his single breach
  weaknesses: Starts with only one breach and struggles to prep spells

  name: Mazra
  background: Mazra is Razra’s studious sister.  From an early age she petitioned
    Brama to access the archives, translated ancient breach magic by age eight, and
    became the youngest breach mage at ten.  She joins the expedition hoping to become
    head of the council of elders.
  appearance: Shown as a young scholar with scrolls and an ornate staff.
  strengths: Mazra’s Research ability lets her destroy one of her unique Mazra cards
    to gain a higher‑requires version or return all her Mazra cards from the set aside
    to her hand
  weaknesses: Her power is tied to her personal deck; if she cannot upgrade her cards
    effectively she falls behind

    background: The scholar Mazra realises that despite her years of study it is her
      chaotic sister Razra who is first to work with the council.  She is shocked
      by a traitor mage who used aether drawn from living beings and begins to question
      her once‑naïve view of the council. Brama assigns her to assist Soskel at the
      Northern Outpost, forcing her to confront the harsh realities of leadership.
    appearance: No detailed physical description; often depicted studying ancient
      tomes.
    strengths: Mazra excels at research and planning
    weaknesses: Her focus on long‑term upgrades can leave her weak early in the game
- id: qu
  name: Qu
  background: Qu is the daughter of Xaxos and was raised in the Void.  She feels torn
    between the darkness of the Void and the light of New Gravehold.  In her story
    she describes her longing to escape the Void’s crushing emptiness and her pledge
    not to let the Nameless claim the world.
  appearance: Depicted with dual‑colored robes representing her Builder and Destroyer
    forms.
  strengths: Qu switches between Builder and Destroyer forms
  weaknesses: Flipping forms at inopportune moments can hinder coordination

    box: Outcasts
    background: After living in New Gravehold for a time, Qu returns to the Void.  She
      confesses that comfort made her uneasy—she felt most alive in battle.  She follows
      her father Xaxos’s call back to the endless dark, hoping that when she returns
      her city will be ready to accept her.
    appearance: Wears dark robes embroidered with Void motifs, her eyes reflecting
      both determination and sadness.
    strengths: Her Combust Aether ability allows her to draw three cards at the end
      of her draw phase, accelerating her deck
    weaknesses: Drawing three extra cards can lead to a larger deck with less control
    story_notes: After finding a measure of peace in New Gravehold, Qu felt the Void
      tug on her heart.  Hearing that her father planned to venture into that darkness
      again, she could not let him go alone.  Qu rejoined Xaxos in the Void just as
      a group of mages battled their way through, surprising her companions with her
      void‑scarred form and quick laughter.  She admonished them not to waste energy
      on illusory skeletons and used her unique knowledge of the Void to navigate
      its dangers.  Though still torn between the light of the surface and the shadows
      below, Qu recognised the pain behind her father’s ambition and challenged him
      when he strayed too close to forbidden power.  At the fountain of souls she
      watched the hope of resurrecting their fallen crumble into horror, yet she helped
      her friends destroy the source of temptation.  Qu remains a bridge between worlds,
      refusing to surrender either her human compassion or her void‑born resilience.
- id: inco
  name: Inco
  background: Inco is a young breach mage with an innate affinity for the natural
    world.  Raised by the spirits of the wilds south of New Gravehold and later adopted
    by Talix, he was nurtured by vines and creatures and still longs for the touch
    of the earth.  Inco communicates with plants and senses their distress; he can
    coax life back into a wilting tree and conjure flowers with a thought.  His path
    through the forest blooms behind him even when death surrounds him, yet this gift
    sometimes runs wild when he is frightened or upset—branches thicken, roots twist
    and saplings burst from the soil in chaotic growth.  Inco remains gentle and earnest,
    but the decay threatening the land fills him with panic and determination to save
    every crop.
  appearance: Portrayed as a lithe youth entwined with vines and budding flowers,
    his skin mottled with green patterns and his hair crowned with leaves.
  strengths: Inco’s connection to plants allows him to rapidly grow vines and blossoms,
    rejuvenate dying vegetation and cause thorny growths that entangle foes.  He can
    sense the health of the land and follows its guidance to track allies.
  weaknesses: His control over growth is tied to his emotions—panic or anger may trigger
    uncontrolled bursts that hinder allies.  In barren or corrupted environments his
    power weakens, and his urgency to save plants can lead him into danger.
  story_notes: 'Inco is earnest and often anxious.  He storms into councils with dirt
    on his hands and urgency in his voice, stumbling over words as he explains that
    leaves are wilting and crops are failing.  Though young, he has practised breach
    magic alongside Razra and shares a friendly rivalry with her.  When he calls “Move
    your roots,” he means it literally: vines lift paths, branches part and roots
    coil to guide or hinder.  Inco’s compassion extends to animals—he embraces the
    metallic beast Rip as if it were family—and he blames himself when plants suffer.  His
    uncontrolled growth in tense moments highlights the tension between a mage’s power
    and the chaos of nature.

    Even when reverent toward all plants, Inco will tear at vines with bare hands
    to free a friend trapped within a living prison.  When brute force fails he draws
    thorny tendrils from the earth, sacrificing growth to cut away shackles.  Discovering
    carved glyphs and familiar insignias etched into the ground shakes his trust;
    he mutters “It can’t be” and turns inward, his usual chatter replaced by stony
    silence.  After freeing Razra from an organic wall he steps aside to let her pick
    up a glowing artefact, reluctant to touch the object himself.  Inco’s path alternates
    between blooming flowers that reassure and chaotic roots that threaten to topple
    trees, reflecting his struggle to balance life and destruction.

    Later, Inco reveals he was raised by one of the plant‑based Nameless the party
    battles.  His grief at the creature’s death mingles with fury at the traitor who
    turned his family against him.  On the journey back to New Gravehold he kicks
    at the ground, hands shaking, unable to meet his friends’ eyes.  At the council
    chambers he accuses elders of hiding the betrayal and of letting their home become
    “carrion.”  Despite his despair he vows to heal the land and expose those who
    would manipulate his kin.  Inco’s ability to sense paths through rot and his willingness
    to lift allies on great leaves or slam the ground to leap over walls of flame
    underscore his intimate connection to the earth.'

    box: Into the Wild
- id: razra
  name: Razra
  background: Razra is Mazra’s younger sister and one of the most headstrong mages
    of her generation.  She struggled to master breach magic until she forged an unbreakable
    bond with a metallic creature named Rip, whose speed and loyalty complement her
    fierce determination.  Eager to prove herself, Razra often rushes ahead of her
    companions and takes on tasks before anyone else arrives—whether mending blighted
    crops or confronting roving Nameless alone.  Her independent spirit can get her
    into trouble, but she never hesitates to defend those she loves.
  appearance: Razra rides a sleek, armored beast whose luminous eyes mirror her own
    defiance.  Her braided hair and scarred forearms speak of battles fought, while
    her cloak is pinned with symbols of her family and of Rip.
  strengths: Razra’s courage and agility allow her to dart through dangerous terrain
    and strike quickly.  Together with Rip she can outmaneuver foes, track paths through
    wilderness and carry messages or supplies at incredible speed.  Her stubborn resolve
    and quick thinking often turn the tide in desperate situations.
  weaknesses: Her impulsive nature leads her to act before thinking, sometimes ignoring
    orders or failing to coordinate with allies.  She depends on Rip for balance and
    may falter if they are separated.  Razra’s need to prove herself can blind her
    to risks and drag her companions into unnecessary danger.
  story_notes: 'Razra is both a source of frustration and inspiration for her friends.  She
    leaves cheeky notes (“catch up if you can”) and dashes off into the wilderness
    to “fix the crops” before anyone else arrives.  Her stubbornness drives Inco mad
    even as he admires her will.  When she sends Rip to guide the party, she trusts
    them to follow her lead.  Razra carries the grief of losing comrades but refuses
    to let it slow her; she digs up relics for safekeeping, fights alongside mutated
    Nameless and burns remains to purify the land.  Her relationship with Inco is
    affectionate and teasing, and she often calls on him to hurry with phrases like
    “move your roots” or “stop dragging your vines.”  Razra embodies youthful audacity
    and the wild hope that the world can still be saved, even if she must run ahead
    to prove it.

    In Into the Wild she rushes north to combat a blight and ends up trapped in a
    vine prison where tendrils of breach energy drain her strength.  Though she jokes
    that she “basically made it” and scolds Inco for arriving late, her hands tremble
    and she confesses she now knows how breaches feel—she has been sucked dry.  Razra
    is blunt about unfair tactics, complaining when explosive flora pursue her like
    living bombs.  She is baffled and outraged when she suspects a woman controlling
    plants alongside a Nameless, remarking that Nameless never help humans—“not usually,
    at least.”  Even so she remains practical: after being freed she grabs a brilliant
    artefact and continues on, helping Rip to dig up treasures and then teasingly
    reprimanding him when he showers her with dirt.  Razra’s bravado masks vulnerability;
    she is quick to embrace friends in relief yet just as quick to charge into the
    next challenge.

    As the expedition continues, Razra’s suspicion of betrayal hardens.  When buried
    objects uncovered in the grove turn out to be powerful relics stolen from New Gravehold,
    she realises someone within their ranks has been smuggling treasures out.  Later
    she sees a cloaked woman throw a scythe of lightning and recognises the veteran
    tattoo on her ankle—proof that a seasoned mage is working against them.  Razra
    and Rip chase the saboteur through walls of flame and across unstable foliage,
    leaping through a hole Rip bites through the blaze.  Though she and Inco cannot
    catch the traitor, Razra returns home seething, her resolve unshaken.  She scratches
    Rip’s head to calm him and tells the council that they must hunt the traitor before
    she devastates their crops and community.  Her mix of fury, loyalty and humour
    continues to galvanise those around her.'

  appearance: A broad‑shouldered young man with solemn eyes and tattoos symbolizing
    his lost Tether.

    aether, destroy cards or add harm when spells are cast

  strengths: Her Missing Half ability searches her deck and set aside pile for all
    copies of a chosen spell and adds them to her hand, then she may prep up to three

  background: 'Ilya is a breach mage from Azer deeply connected to the flow of aether.  Her

    tattoos that match Kel’s, symbolizing their lifelong bond.'
  appearance: Depicted with vibrant tattoos, swirling aether around her hands.
  strengths: Ilya’s Life Embrace ability lets any ally cast all of their prepared
    spells without exhausting them, allowing a huge burst of harm or support
  weaknesses: Her ability provides no direct harm and depends entirely on allies having
    strong prepared spells
  story_notes: Ilya is the more contemplative of the two Azerian Tethers.  She sees
    the flow of aether and uses this insight to guide her partner and allies, carefully
    timing her support so that others can strike hard.  In the Outcasts expedition
    she maintains the aether bubble that allows the group to breathe in the Void,
    warns them of an approaching dream‑eater, and helps them prepare for battle when
    skeletal armies appear.  Her steady presence and calm voice ground Kel and the
    others as they make difficult decisions about trust, redemption and the use of
    forbidden power.

    tattoos serve as a promise to protect one another.  Kel fights fiercely to defend
    her homeland and her partner.
  appearance: A tall woman with intricate tattoos on her arms and shoulders, carrying
    a staff adorned with gems.
  strengths: Focused on gems and relics, Kel’s Trulite of Energy ability returns up
    to two gems or relics she played this turn to her hand
  weaknesses: Kel requires a high‑value market of gems and relics to maximize her
    ability
  story_notes: Kel and her partner Ilya act as inseparable Tethers from the village
    of Azer.  When a monstrous experiment attacks their home they carve glyphs into
    the ground and channel aether through their matching tattoos to protect villagers.  They
    then join a group of travellers on an expedition through the Void, taking turns
    feeding energy into a shared portal to maintain breathable air.  Kel’s resilience
    and fierce loyalty carry her through battles against dream clouds and skeletal
    armies.  Throughout the journey she reminds her companions to trust in each other’s
    strengths and to honour the bonds that give them power.

  background: Thraxir was once a human but was transformed into a mindless monster
    by the Void.  After regaining his senses, he struggles to remember his old life.  Xaxos
    empathizes with his plight, noting that both of them feel estranged from New Gravehold
    and hope to rediscover their humanity together.
  appearance: A towering warrior wrapped in chains, his eyes glowing with remnants
    of Void power.
  strengths: Thraxir’s Nameless Siphon ability allows him to cast up to three spells
    (or four if he has all breaches open)
  weaknesses: He relies on having many open breaches to maximize harm; early in the
    game he is slower
  story_notes: Thraxir was once a legendary breach mage of old Gravehold whose exploits
    became myth.  He vanished into the Void and returned centuries later as the fearsome
    Knight of Shackles, clad in corroded armour and commanding armies of skeletal
    lesser foes.  For years he was thought lost to madness, but during the Outcasts
    expedition he regained enough clarity to speak.  He encountered a band of mages
    seeking the fountain of souls and, though his voice cracked from disuse, confirmed
    that the pool existed and that he had survived its horrors.  His admission galvanised
    Z’hana and her companions to continue their quest.  Thraxir himself still bears
    the weight of Nameless power; he warns others to destroy the fountain rather than
    embrace it, hinting that his own transformation was the price of drinking from
    its depths.  Though he fights alongside the mages against common threats, he is
    resigned to remain between worlds, neither fully human nor wholly Nameless.

    appearance: A gaunt figure whose limbs are laced with web‑like scars; faint chitinous
      protrusions on his shoulders hint at the creature he once tried to become.
    strengths: His Convergence ability allows him to cast any player’s prepared spell
      and give it +3 harm (from Outcasts overview table)
    weaknesses: After his fusion with a spider Nameless, he is physically fragile
      and suffers pain when drawing on the Void; if he pushes too far his body threatens
      to unravel.
    story_notes: Arachnos was once a devout student of Xaxos who viewed the Void as
      the key to defeating the Nameless.  Banished from New Gravehold for forbidden
      experiments, he attempted to fuse himself with a giant spider Nameless deep
      in the Void.  When the fountain of souls exploded, a human‑sized hand rose from
      the drained pool and Arachnos crawled out, half‑transformed and covered in webbing.  He
      teetered between human and monster, his eyes clouded with pain and memory.  Thraxir
      and the mages helped him to his feet, and he whispered of being caught somewhere
      between man and monster.  Arachnos regrets his hubris but still believes there
      is power to be harnessed in the Void; he now counsels caution and urges others
      to find balance instead of courting destruction.  His partial transformation
      serves as a living warning of what happens when one reaches too deeply into
      forbidden pools.  In his journals from exile he recounts adjusting runes to stabilise a breach after a previous experiment sealed a rabbit inside the Void; he then used a captured wolf as his next subject, convinced that a stronger animal would survive the Void essence and adapt to contain it.  He wrote excitedly that success would usher in the future of their race and allow him to begin human trials.  This entry foreshadows the creation of the Nameless Fenrix and underscores how his pursuit of power endangered both himself and others.

    background: Indira’s story in Legacy of Gravehold reveals her deep regret for
      past cowardice.  She admits that when Brama grew paranoid and banished Arachnos
      and Karak she celebrated their exile, but she remained silent when her own teacher
      was sentenced to isolation.  Indira now recognises she was afraid to stand up
      for what she believed and vows that she will not let fear guide her again. Her
      magic has always been irregular, influenced by the void and Yan Magda’s teachings.
    appearance: No specific physical description is provided; she is known for irregular,
      void‑touched magic.
    strengths: Indira wields unstable void magic that can produce bursts of power
      and manipulate breach effects
    weaknesses: Her magic is erratic and difficult to control, sometimes causing unintended
      effects
    story_notes: Indira senses dark forces at work within Gravehold.  In her letters
      she describes dwindling numbers despite the arrival of Yan Magda and her companions,
      noting that faith has sustained the survivors but is also coveted by a cult
      known as the Hollow Crown.  She explains that its acolytes are former mages
      practising forbidden blood rituals in the rubble of the Craghollows, and that
      through their devotion the Crown draws unstoppable power.  Unlike other Nameless,
      the Crown inspires reverence rather than fear and sees citizens as potential
      worshippers.  Indira warns that Gravehold has become a cage for those under
      the Crown’s sway; unless faith is reclaimed and the cult exposed, there may
      be fates worse than death.  As she stares into the dim light of the city she contemplates the words of Yan Magda, Brama and Phaedraxa—time is like water, our lives are drops of blood and the end is written in the ash of its beginning.  Hearing the bells toll and smelling the burnt air of a breach she braces for another battle that may be her last.
