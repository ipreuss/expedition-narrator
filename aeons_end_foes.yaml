# List of foes (minor nemeses)
foes:
- name: The Cultist
  box: The Descent
  background: 'In an abandoned city Adelheim spots another human across the firelight
    and wonders why they must fight fellow survivors.  The man’s mind has been warped
    by the Void—he mumbles to himself and tends a flickering ritual.  This
    cultist now serves the Nameless and fuels dark rites to summon greater horrors.

    '
  appearance: A ragged figure clutching a burning brazier, eyes glazed with madness.
  strengths: 'During the nemesis main phase the Cultist’s Feed the Ritual ability
    causes his Volatile Pylon to gain life and removes power tokens from the Ritual of Flame.  If
    unchecked the ritual completes, triggering powerful effects.  He can also place
    gnaw tokens on players’ cards or supply piles, hindering card acquisition.

    '
  weaknesses: 'The Cultist has low life and relies on his Pylon and Ritual tokens
    to do harm.  Removing those tokens and focusing on his supports neutralises his
    threat quickly.

    '
- name: The Swarm
  box: The Descent
  background: 'Leisan warns that the Void is full of tiny creatures that burrow into
    the ground.  If ignored a single larva becomes a swarm; she has seen them devour
    entire camps before anyone knew what was happening.  This
    foe commands a hive of Broodlings and overwhelms mages with numbers.

    '
  appearance: A seething mass of insectoid minions pouring out of tunnels and cracks.
  strengths: 'Its Call the Hive ability retrieves minions from the nemesis discard
    pile or, if none are present, places two Broodlings into play.  Over time the
    board fills with Broodlings that chip away at life and cause additional effects
    when destroyed.  The sheer number of minions can overwhelm players.

    '
  weaknesses: 'Broodlings have low life and can be eliminated quickly with area attacks.  By
    clearing the board regularly and preventing minions from accumulating, the Swarm’s
    engine stalls.

    '
- name: The Corrosion
  box: The Descent
  background: 'Raven encounters a monstrous creature that knows only hunger and thirst.  It
    scrapes through tunnels trying to regain warmth and devours everything in its
    path.  Though she feels a flicker of pity for its desperation,
    she knows it will reduce Gravehold to dust if unchecked.

    '
  appearance: A formless mass of rust and acid slithering along the cavern walls,
    dissolving all it touches.
  strengths: 'The Corrosion’s Return to Dust ability removes two power tokens from
    each power in play and deals 5 damage to Gravehold.  It steadily erodes the players’
    resources and punishes them for leaving powers on the table.  Its effects ignore
    player life totals and strike directly at the city.

    '
  weaknesses: 'It cannot attack players directly.  By minimising the number of active
    powers and focusing on direct damage, the mages can outpace its corrosive onslaught.

    '
- name: The Scavenger
  box: The Descent
  background: 'Mazahaedron notes that not all Void creatures become Nameless.  Some
    lurk in shadows, creeping up on half‑dead victims to finish them off.  The
    Scavenger prowls behind the main battle, waiting for wounded mages to falter so
    it can strike.

    '
  appearance: A gaunt, shadowy beast with elongated claws and a gaping maw, stalking
    the weak.
  strengths: 'Once it reaches five charges the Scavenger’s Cull the Stragglers ability
    deals four damage to the player with the lowest life.  This foe targets weak links,
    forcing the team to keep everyone’s health high.  Its presence pressures players
    to heal and defend vulnerable allies.

    '
  weaknesses: 'It requires time to build up charges and does nothing until then.  By
    keeping everyone’s life high and racing to defeat the main nemesis, players can
    render the Scavenger’s effect moot.

    '
- name: The Storm
  box: The Caverns
  background: 'Fawn recalls battling in a thunderstorm where the ground turned to
    mud and lightning struck randomly.  She groans that her hair was a mess and that
    the combat was miserable.  The Storm embodies this
    chaotic weather, lashing out at the mages with blasts of electricity.

    '
  appearance: A roiling cloud of purple lightning hovering over the battlefield, crackling
    with energy.
  strengths: 'Its Bloody Conduit ability targets the player with the most prepped
    spells: that player gains a Shock card and suffers damage equal to their number
    of prepped spells.  Shock cards clutter players’ hands and deal damage when destroyed,
    punishing teams that build up spells.

    '
  weaknesses: 'Players can mitigate its effect by limiting the number of prepped spells.  Without
    many targets its ability is less threatening.

    '
- name: The Traitor
  box: The Abyss
  background: 'The Traitor believes his allies are small‑minded fools who fail to
    grasp the power within reach.  He claims he will become the strongest mage so
    that he can protect everyone—even if he must betray them now.  His
    selfish determination drives him to harness dark forces at any cost.

    '
  appearance: A once‑heroic mage whose eyes blaze with Void energy; his skin is cracked
    like obsidian.
  strengths: 'The Traitor’s Bloody Conduit ability costs five charges.  If the nemesis’s
    turn order card is in the discard pile he shuffles it back into the deck; otherwise
    he unleashes three times, triggering the nemesis’s unleash effect repeatedly.  He
    also has a rule that if the nemesis would draw a card and cannot, the players
    immediately lose the game.

    '
  weaknesses: 'Highly telegraphed: players can see when he will act based on his charge
    level and plan accordingly.  Focusing on removing his charges or manipulating
    the turn order can blunt his impact.'

  meta: 'This foe is actually another manifestation of Xaxos who has betrayed his comrades.'
