# List of foes (minor nemeses)
foes:
- name: The Cultist
  box: The Descent
  background: 'A human whose mind has been warped by the Void. He mumbles incoherently
    to himself while tending a flickering ritual brazier, his eyes glazed with fanatical
    devotion. Now a servant of the Nameless, this cultist fuels dark rites designed
    to summon greater horrors into the world. He moves with jerky, unnatural motions
    and shows no recognition of his former humanity.

    '
  appearance: A ragged figure clutching a burning brazier, eyes glazed with madness.
  strengths: 'During the nemesis main phase the Cultist’s Feed the Ritual ability
    causes his Volatile Pylon to gain life and removes power tokens from the Ritual of Flame.  If
    unchecked the ritual completes, triggering powerful effects.  He can also place
    gnaw tokens on players’ cards or supply piles, hindering card acquisition.

    '
  weaknesses: 'The Cultist has low life and relies on his Pylon and Ritual tokens
    to do harm.  Removing those tokens and focusing on his supports neutralises his
    threat quickly.

    '
- name: The Swarm
  box: The Descent
  background: 'A hive-mind of tiny Void creatures that burrow through the ground and
    multiply with terrifying speed. What begins as a single larva quickly becomes a
    seething mass of insectoid horrors capable of devouring entire camps before anyone
    realizes the danger. The Swarm commands legions of Broodlings that pour from tunnels
    and cracks, overwhelming defenders through sheer numbers rather than individual
    strength.

    '
  appearance: A seething mass of insectoid minions pouring out of tunnels and cracks.
  strengths: 'Its Call the Hive ability retrieves minions from the nemesis discard
    pile or, if none are present, places two Broodlings into play.  Over time the
    board fills with Broodlings that chip away at life and cause additional effects
    when destroyed.  The sheer number of minions can overwhelm players.

    '
  weaknesses: 'Broodlings have low life and can be eliminated quickly with area attacks.  By
    clearing the board regularly and preventing minions from accumulating, the Swarm’s
    engine stalls.

    '
- name: The Corrosion
  box: The Descent
  background: 'A formless abomination driven by endless hunger and desperate need for
    warmth. It scrapes through tunnels, dissolving stone and metal alike as it searches
    for sustenance. The Corrosion knows nothing but consumption—it devours everything
    in its path with mindless determination. Though pitiable in its desperation, this
    creature will reduce cities to dust if left unchecked, leaving only rust and ruin
    in its wake.

    '
  appearance: A formless mass of rust and acid slithering along the cavern walls,
    dissolving all it touches.
  strengths: 'The Corrosion’s Return to Dust ability removes two power tokens from
    each power in play and deals 5 damage to Gravehold.  It steadily erodes the players’
    resources and punishes them for leaving powers on the table.  Its effects ignore
    player life totals and strike directly at the city.

    '
  weaknesses: 'It cannot attack players directly.  By minimising the number of active
    powers and focusing on direct damage, the mages can outpace its corrosive onslaught.

    '
- name: The Scavenger
  box: The Descent
  background: 'Not all Void creatures become Nameless—some lurk in shadows, patient
    and opportunistic. The Scavenger is such a beast, creeping along the edges of
    battle to finish off the wounded and weakened. It prowls behind the main conflict,
    watching with predatory cunning for any defender to falter. When it senses weakness,
    it strikes with terrifying speed, dragging its prey into the darkness.

    '
  appearance: A gaunt, shadowy beast with elongated claws and a gaping maw, stalking
    the weak.
  strengths: 'Once it reaches five charges the Scavenger’s Cull the Stragglers ability
    deals four damage to the player with the lowest life.  This foe targets weak links,
    forcing the team to keep everyone’s health high.  Its presence pressures players
    to heal and defend vulnerable allies.

    '
  weaknesses: 'It requires time to build up charges and does nothing until then.  By
    keeping everyone’s life high and racing to defeat the main nemesis, players can
    render the Scavenger’s effect moot.

    '
- name: The Storm
  box: The Caverns
  background: 'A living tempest of Void energy that crackles with purple lightning and
    rolls across the battlefield like a sentient thundercloud. The Storm embodies chaos
    itself, lashing out with unpredictable bolts of electricity that seek out concentrations
    of magical power. It turns the ground to mud, fills the air with ozone, and makes
    every step treacherous. Those who gather too much arcane energy become lightning
    rods for its wrath.

    '
  appearance: A roiling cloud of purple lightning hovering over the battlefield, crackling
    with energy.
  strengths: 'Its Bloody Conduit ability targets the player with the most prepped
    spells: that player gains a Shock card and suffers damage equal to their number
    of prepped spells.  Shock cards clutter players’ hands and deal damage when destroyed,
    punishing teams that build up spells.

    '
  weaknesses: 'Players can mitigate its effect by limiting the number of prepped spells.  Without
    many targets its ability is less threatening.

    '
- name: The Traitor
  box: The Abyss
  background: 'A mage who has turned against their own kind, corrupted by the seductive
    promise of Void power. The Traitor views former allies as small-minded fools who
    fail to grasp the power within reach. With skin cracked like obsidian and eyes
    blazing with dark energy, they wield familiar magic twisted to terrible purpose.
    Convinced that only through embracing the Void can they become strong enough to
    protect what remains, the Traitor fights with the desperate fury of the self-righteous.

    '
  appearance: A once‑heroic mage whose eyes blaze with Void energy; his skin is cracked
    like obsidian.
  strengths: 'The Traitor’s Bloody Conduit ability costs five charges.  If the nemesis’s
    turn order card is in the discard pile he shuffles it back into the deck; otherwise
    he unleashes three times, triggering the nemesis’s unleash effect repeatedly.  He
    also has a rule that if the nemesis would draw a card and cannot, the players
    immediately lose the game.

    '
  weaknesses: 'Highly telegraphed: players can see when he will act based on his charge
    level and plan accordingly.  Focusing on removing his charges or manipulating
    the turn order can blunt his impact.'

  meta: 'This foe is actually another manifestation of Xaxos who has betrayed his comrades.'
