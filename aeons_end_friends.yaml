# List of friends (support characters)
friends:
- name: Adelheim, the Blacksmith
  box: The Descent
  background: 'A seasoned weaponsmith, Adelheim continues to repair and forge weapons
    for his clan even after the world has fallen.  He notes that the clan’s armaments
    are old and rusted, yet someone must keep them in working order.  As
    a friend he joins expeditions to offer support by reclaiming useful scrap for
    the mages.

    '
  appearance: An older blacksmith with soot‑stained hands and a determined gaze.
  strengths: 'Adelheim has four charge spaces.  When fully charged his ability Gather Scrap
    lets each player return up to three 0‑cost cards from their discard pile to their
    hand, effectively recycling Crystals and Sparks.  This accelerates early‑game
    economy and gives mages extra resources to spend or cast.

    '
  weaknesses: 'His power only retrieves 0‑cost cards, so its impact diminishes once
    players upgrade their decks.  He provides no direct damage or healing.

    '
- name: Fawn, the Alchemist
  box: The Descent
  background: 'Fawn always dreamed of being a witch.  She practised the sister‑words
    for years but nothing worked, and she resigned herself to tending vats of caustic
    brew.  When new magic finally came easily—even at her older age—she couldn’t wait
    to unleash it.  She now uses her concoctions to support
    the breach mages.

    '
  appearance: A cheerful woman with alchemical flasks and singed hair, clad in a stained
    apron.
  strengths: 'Fawn’s ability Caustic Brew costs six charges and deals damage equal
    to the total cost of spells in her Cauldron.  After dealing damage she must destroy
    one of those spells.  Used wisely, she can convert high‑cost spells into a big
    burst of damage against the nemesis.

    '
  weaknesses: 'Requires a large investment of charges and spell cards to maximise
    her attack.  Destroying spells reduces her long‑term firepower, so timing is critical.

    '
- name: Myrna, the Scholar
  box: The Descent
  background: 'Myrna comes from a long line of women who rebelled against authority
    and hid knowledge in plain sight.  She now serves as the family’s eyes and ears,
    memorising everything so future generations can learn from the past.  She
    aids the mages by sharing ancient wisdom gathered over centuries.

    '
  appearance: A quiet scholar carrying stacks of notes and scrolls.
  strengths: 'With four charge spaces, her ability Study the Ancients grants four
    knowledge tokens when fully charged.  Knowledge tokens can be spent by any player
    on their turn for various effects, providing flexibility and support to the team.

    '
  weaknesses: 'She contributes no direct damage or healing on her own; her value depends
    on players making good use of her knowledge tokens.

    '
- name: Dalana, the Healer
  box: The Descent
  background: 'Dalana grew up alongside Brama but was never blessed with the sister‑words.  She
    feared her friendship would end when Brama became an initiate, yet she refused
    to abandon those she cared about.  Instead she trained
    in the healing arts and now travels with expeditions to mend wounds and tend to
    the injured.

    '
  appearance: A kindly woman in simple clothes carrying bandages and salves.
  strengths: 'Dalana’s ability Bandage requires five charges and allows any player
    or Gravehold to gain four life.  This potent heal can save mages from defeat and
    shore up Gravehold’s defences during long battles.

    '
  weaknesses: 'She offers no offensive capabilities.  If the team does not need healing
    her charges may sit unused.

    '
- name: Joanna, the Merchant
  box: The Caverns
  background: 'Joanna is a shrewd merchant who respects breach mages but believes
    artisans and craftspeople should profit from their work.  She remarks that mages
    could accomplish little without the people who craft their gear and insists those
    workers deserve a fair share.  Joanna accompanies expeditions
    to broker deals and trade up valuable supplies.

    '
  appearance: A well‑dressed woman with a ledger in hand and a glint of cunning in
    her eye.
  strengths: 'Her Barter ability allows her to destroy any number of cards from the
    market; then a player gains a card costing up to three times the number of destroyed
    cards.  With careful timing she can remove unwanted low‑cost cards and grant powerful
    relics or spells to the team.

    '
  weaknesses: 'Destroying market cards permanently reduces the supply pool.  If misused
    it can deprive the team of critical cards later in the game.

    '
- name: Xaxos, the Arcane Researcher
  box: The Abyss
  character_id: xaxos
  background: 'A young scholar longs to become a mage like her mother but struggles
    to master the sister‑words.  She pours through books about the Void and corruption,
    dreaming of fighting alongside the breach mages.  As
    the Arcane Researcher she experiments with new spells and shares her findings
    with allies.

    '
  appearance: A studious girl clutching a stack of books and a mysterious amulet,
    surrounded by glowing charts.
  strengths: 'Xaxos has four charge spaces and a boon deck.  When fully charged she
    uses Experimental Success to draw two cards from her boon deck, providing unique
    boons that can grant additional actions, aether or damage.  Shield tokens she
    provides can absorb damage on behalf of players.

    '
  weaknesses: 'Her boons are random and may not align with immediate needs.  She lacks
    direct ways to damage the nemesis or heal allies.

    '
