  1st Wave:
    setting: |
      Unexplained hoof‑like tracks draw a band of breach mages out of the safety of Gravehold and into the uncharted depths below.  Their journey leads them through collapsing bridges, narrow passages, glittering amethyst caverns and ancient vaults where daylight filters down from cracks high above.  Guided by a pale, horned creature, they venture farther than any living person has in an age and eventually return having lost much of what they saw and learned.
    environment: |
      The journey unfolds in constricting passages carved of rock and shadow.  Gemlight flickers on dripping walls as mirror worms shimmer in blues and greens.  Chasms open beneath the party’s feet, forcing rope crossings and leaps over broken stone.  Echoing chambers hold the remnants of ancient builders—rusted pipes, runes and mosaics—and vast halls of violet crystal glow with their own light.  At the fringes of this labyrinth the air thins, a soft breeze carries the scent of open sky, and a staircase hewn from the rock leads to a vault where rays of sunlight reveal carvings and polished tiles unseen for generations.
    mood: |
      The tone oscillates between tension and wonder.  Fear, fatigue and doubt gnaw at the mages as they descend, yet humour and camaraderie brighten their exchanges.  Moments of awe—discovering a cavern of amethyst, touching true daylight—are quickly shadowed by encounters with Nameless horrors.  Dreams turn sour, nightmares invade, and after the final battle the party wakes with blurred memories, underscoring how fragile hope and knowledge are in the face of the Void.
    themes: |
      Survival in oppressive darkness; trust and perseverance under pressure; exploration of forgotten places; the lure of knowledge versus the risk of forgetting; the interplay of companionship, curiosity and fear; and brief glimpses of the lost world above.
    possible_expeditions: |
      Chase strange tracks into unexplored depths; escort or follow a mysterious creature that knows secret ways; investigate ancient vaults carved by unknown builders; cross unstable bridges and chasms in search of daylight; and confront forces that threaten to steal memories or histories before they can be preserved.
  2nd Wave:
    setting: |
      In the second wave the mages discover that part of their city has been dragged into the Void itself.  Bells ring in empty streets while apples and carts hover mid‑fall.  No breach in the membrane can be seen, yet a faint plea draws the party across the threshold and into an uncanny realm.  They step into a world where the ruins of civilisation meld with twisted rock and bones, where rivers flow like oil and monolithic stones hum with memories, and where time seems to slow or stop.  Their journey becomes a search not just for a lost friend but for a way to restore what the Void has stolen without losing themselves.
    environment: |
      The landscape of wave 2 is a surreal Void realm distorted by time and gravity.  Frozen fragments of the city hang over bottomless chasms while footsteps echo through tunnels carved from ancient vertebrae.  A viscous blue‑brown river, thick as oil, snakes through the darkness, and travellers must cross over the bones of a titanic beast or through the muck as masked acolytes chant on the shore.  Ahead looms a towering monolith, a shard of some other world, whose carvings whisper of histories long forgotten.  Iridescent pulses in the sky and distant hums guide the party when all other bearings fail.
    mood: |
      Haunted yet hopeful.  The survivors feel guilt over past failures and fear of what the Void might hold, yet loyalty and determination keep them moving.  Arguments flare and humour surfaces as they grapple with their own regrets.  Dreams, voices and memories intrude, and hours stretch into days as time warps around them.  Through it all, forgiveness and shared purpose temper despair, weaving a sense of found family.
    themes: |
      Redemption and loyalty; the strength of found family; confronting isolation and guilt; following faint calls through alien spaces; navigating distortions of time and reality; the pull between personal promises and the duty to protect one’s community; and the realization that even in the Void life and compassion endure.
    possible_expeditions: |
      Pursue echoing calls into warped pockets of the Void; investigate cities frozen in amber to free those trapped within; bargain with chanting cultists by a river of oil and blood; ascend the ribs of colossal skeletons to find pathways across the abyss; converse with monolithic stones that remember other worlds; and delve into distorted landscapes where time bends, seeking to rescue lost friends and reclaim pieces of their home.
  3rd Wave:
    setting: |
      Wave 3 chronicles the fall of old Gravehold and the birth of a new community in its shadow.  A catastrophic attack by a towering Nameless shatters the city; mages race through burning streets and swirling breaches to hold back hordes of minions while civilians flee into the caverns.  Once the dust settles, the survivors retreat into the labyrinth below, where their elders urge them to forget what was lost and learn to harness their inner power.  In the dark tunnels they train, rescue the wounded and begin to rebuild, even as rumours of betrayal and hidden threats simmer among them.
    environment: |
      The Wave 3 landscape is a tale of two worlds.  Above, flames consume familiar markets and homes while a colossal breach in the sky spits blades and darkness.  Towers topple, stone collapses and gemlight is drowned by smoke.  Below, survivors navigate narrow passageways choked with dust and fallen debris, lit only by flickering light and the occasional glow of breach magic.  The tunnels are a web of caverns both known and newly uncovered—some filled with rubble and memories, others opening into unexplored vaults.  Echoing cries and tremors accompany the work of digging through collapsed halls, and strange new paths reveal secret chambers that once lay hidden beneath the city.
    mood: |
      Urgent and tragic at first, as mages scramble to save their home while the world crumbles around them.  Shock and grief set in as survivors realise that their city is gone and many friends and teachers are buried beneath the collapse.  Anger and blame flare—particularly toward those who sought forbidden power—but guilt and regret quickly give way to determination.  In the tunnels, the mood shifts toward resilience and camaraderie: elders counsel patience and forgetting, young mages train and support each other, and hope flickers as each wounded survivor is pulled from the rubble.  Throughout, there is an undercurrent of mistrust as whispers of betrayal surface and fear that the Nameless will return.
    themes: |
      Sacrifice and heroism in the face of overwhelming odds; the burden of leadership and the consequences of misuse of power; grief, guilt and forgiveness; surviving a catastrophe and forging a new community from its ruins; mentorship and the passing of knowledge under dire circumstances; the tension between remembering and forgetting; training novices to become defenders; protecting the helpless while confronting betrayal from within; and resilience amid the collapse of home.
    possible_expeditions: |
      Stand against waves of Nameless minions to give civilians time to escape; weave through burning streets to rescue trapped citizens or recover treasured relics; navigate collapsing caverns to find survivors and stabilise tunnels; escort wounded mages to safety while dodging debris and breaches; train novice mages in the dark, carving out space for them to practice safely; seek out fallen teachers or companions believed lost beneath the rubble; explore newly uncovered vaults for supplies and knowledge; confront re‑emerging minions led by a scarred lieutenant; quell outbreaks of panic and suspicion when signs of betrayal appear; and help transform underground chambers into a resilient new settlement while preparing for future threats; defend a fledgling settlement and train with veteran mentors to channel unique abilities; track fleeing minions or signs to discover verdant surface landscapes; harvest organic pods from a breeding ground and collaborate with a master craftsperson to forge specialized equipment; journey to locate other survivor groups and establish supply lines; rescue a captured leader from a mind‑controlling foe and close its breach; craft personalized spells and choose specializations with guidance from seasoned instructors; investigate poisonous fogs and other emerging breaches that threaten underground camps; battle through choking fogs to save the settlement; hold your ground against memory‑devouring creatures to secure rare resources; fortify mental defences with an anchor while retrieving potent ore; refine raw pulse energy into magical power; prepare for a final confrontation with a colossal foe by training and enhancing your abilities; and confront a former ally corrupted by forbidden power, deciding whether to redeem or defeat them while sealing the last breach.
  4th Wave:
    setting: |
      After the fall of old Gravehold and the cataclysmic defeat of Maelstrom, the survivors leave the caves behind and build a new refuge on the surface.  They call their new home New Gravehold and vow not just to survive but to thrive in this strange verdant world.  Led by the remaining breach mages they clear ruins, plant gardens, and learn to live under open skies.  For a time they close their breaches and try to live without magic, trusting that the Nameless are gone for good.  Years later, however, strange creatures begin emerging from the wilds and the people realise the war is not over.  Expedition parties set out to trace these threats to their source, hoping to end the Nameless assaults once and for all and free themselves from the burden of breach magic.
    environment: |
      The wave 4 landscape blends the rubble of a collapsed city with untamed wilderness.  Crumbling stone walls and shattered towers lie half buried beneath grasses and vines.  Towering trees and dense undergrowth reclaim streets where markets once thrived.  Open sky and warm sunlight replace the dim gemlight of the caves, but summer storms lash at the settlement and wild beasts prowl at the edge of torchlight.  To the north the familiar trails of New Gravehold sink into boggy swampland where the air is muggy and thick in your lungs.  Branches creak overhead and even midday sun struggles to pierce the oppressive shade.  Crackling breach energy makes hair stand on end as swirling portals open in forest clearings.  In some areas time seems to warp: leaves age and crumble within moments and skeletal creatures leave blighted footprints where nothing grows.  Blizzards can sweep through temperate woods without warning, driven by void‑twisted predators whose howls freeze breath.  Beyond the walls, the land is dotted with ancient portals and the lairs of new Nameless, their forms unknown.  Survivors tread carefully among unfamiliar flora, wary of energies that still pulse in the earth.
      Hidden beneath this wilderness lie forgotten bunkers and secret forges.  In these subterranean workshops tongues of flame flicker in darkness and hammers ring on metal as isolated survivors craft weapons and artefacts.  Discovering such chambers means encountering lone forgemasters and the glowing runes that outline their work, offering both danger and hope.

      Beyond the open skies and ruined streets lie groves of ancient trees whose branches seem almost sentient.  In some stands of willow the limbs sway as though guiding travellers, brushing aside leaves to reveal paths or pressing together to warn of peril.  Carvings in the bark mirror the strange glyphs found on stone pedestals: symbols that siphon lingering aether from breaches and pulse with violet light to lure Nameless like beacons.  Where these glyphs congregate, vines twist together into wicker prisons that encase the unwary and feed their energy into glittering artefacts.  Freeing friends from such plant shackles may require tearing at the very life one seeks to protect or summoning thorny growth to rip through living walls.  As Inco’s emotions spill over, roots heave up the soil, trees topple and flowers bloom at his feet, contrasting with the decay around him.  With every step into the northern wilds the party feels the weight of someone else’s design—an unseen hand carving runes, turning growth against them and hinting at a human mind behind the whispering leaves.

      Further afield, farms and guard towers give way to battle‑scarred clearings where armies of brambles march like soldiers.  These living thickets ooze unstable green pus and burst into clouds of decay when struck.  A massive vine‑covered bull leads them, dripping with void essence and bristling with nettles.  Towers crumble, blue voids open in the air and scythes of pure electricity cut through the canopy, hinting at foes who combine breach magic with botanical corruption.  Cloaked figures maintain glowing glyphs at the edges of battle, feeding energy into both traps and minions.  Pathways are littered with fallen cultists wearing familiar insignias scratched into the soil, and buried caches of artefacts lie hidden under ancient roots—powerful objects that should be locked away in New Gravehold but have been unearthed by unknown hands.
    mood: |
      Hopeful yet cautious.  Building New Gravehold fills the survivors with a sense of purpose and renewal; life in the sun feels like a second chance.  The memory of their losses and Dezmodia’s sacrifice lingers, and the fear of another betrayal tempers their optimism.  As expeditions venture into swamps and forests to recover missing mages and relics, uneasy sensations of being watched and the presence of cultists loyal to fallen leaders sow mistrust.  Grief for fallen comrades and the weight of promised obligations mingle with wonder at the power still lurking in the earth.  Strange void artefacts and blighted landscapes evoke both dread and temptation as some mages question whether to wield dark energies for good.  Determination hardens into resolve—parties form not out of curiosity but necessity, driven by duty and the belief that the Nameless threat can be ended forever without repeating past mistakes.
      As crops fail and infection spreads, urgency replaces cautious optimism.  Panic, stubbornness and teasing erupt among young mages as they argue over how to respond.  The sight of colourful blooms sprouting around a mage’s feet offers fleeting hope against a backdrop of decay, while the discovery of glyphs that compel Nameless invites both relief and dread.  Uncontrolled growth triggered by fear may topple trees and entangle allies; reverence for plants clashes with the need to tear vines to free a friend.  Suspicions that a human hand is carving runes and manipulating flora sow mistrust.  The burden of controlling nature—and the fear of losing it entirely—presses the survivors onward even when exhaustion begs for rest.  Moments of camaraderie and jesting sit alongside grief and disillusionment when clues point to familiar insignias etched in the soil.  Hope flickers whenever animals guide the way or flowers bloom around a mage’s steps, reminding them of their bond with the land.
      The revelation that priceless artefacts have been stolen from the city and used as lures shakes the community’s trust in its own leaders.  Whispers of a traitor among the veteran mages and the sight of a tattoo reserved for elders on a fleeing saboteur create a sense of paranoia.  Anger flares when councils choose secrecy over truth, and younger mages question authority while pledging to expose corruption.  Grief deepens when family and home are called “carrion,” yet determination hardens as mages vow to cleanse the land, rescue those manipulated by traitors and rebuild a world where betrayal cannot take root.
    themes: |
      Rebirth from ruin; learning to trust and rebuild after catastrophe; the tension between abandoning magic and wielding it responsibly; leadership under scrutiny after betrayal; the hope of a world free from Nameless; confronting human cultists who would harness Void power; rescuing lost comrades and treasures; honouring the fallen through rituals and remembrance; confronting the temptation to use forbidden artefacts; dealing with unnatural aging and decay; surviving sudden climate shifts; and balancing mercy with vigilance in a land where corruption can fester in corpses and hearts alike.
      Hidden bunkers, secret forges and forgotten survivors; the rediscovery of lost mages and the bonds forged with them; the healing power of craft and creation amid ruin; and the importance of guiding those who have lost their memories back to the community.
      The tension between nurturing growth and halting decay; the ethics of luring enemies with powerful glyphs; learning to trust and rein in headstrong allies; finding balance between controlling natural forces and respecting their autonomy; and rescuing animal companions and their mages from blight and Void mutations.
      The mystery of who carves the glyphs that beckon Nameless and how far humans might go to harness their power; the conflict between reverence for living things and the necessity of destroying them to save loved ones; the temptation to hide painful truths from friends; and the challenge of reuniting family while confronting signs of betrayal carved in the soil.
      Traitors within one’s own ranks and the cost of secrecy; the line between protecting the community and deceiving it; the complexity of Nameless who are family to some and weapons to others; and the duty to hold leaders accountable even when doing so might cause chaos.  These themes underscore that the greatest threats can arise not only from the Void but also from those sworn to defend against it.
    possible_expeditions: |
      Track a missing expedition northward through swamps and wetlands to recover lost relics and comrades; confront splinter groups who use Nameless energy in hopes of “saving” the world; venture into bogs and forests to prevent insectoid creatures from encroaching on New Gravehold; burn corrupted remains to protect the soil and water; perform rituals for fallen heroes and retrieve precious artefacts from Nameless experiments; rescue aged survivors from blighted zones and restore their vitality; follow rumours of cultists carrying powerful artefacts deeper into unknown territory; investigate swirling breaches that leak temporal energies causing rapid aging; brave sudden blizzards conjured by void beasts; trace gigantic paw prints to uncover the lairs of unseen predators; unearth treasures buried by lost comrades beneath ancient trees; salvage void artefacts outlined in glowing runes and decide whether to destroy or purify them; and navigate moral dilemmas over whether to harness dark artefacts—all while weighing the risks of reawakening breach magic.
      Seek out hidden bunkers and forges beneath forests or swamps; rescue isolated survivors from these chambers and bring them back to New Gravehold; gather the weapons and tools scattered around secret workshops and decide whether to wield or retire them; rest after hard battles and listen for the sound of hollow ground that might conceal a trapdoor; and escort newfound allies home while fending off those who would exploit the Void’s power.
      Investigate blighted croplands and decaying forests; follow trails of thriving flowers to locate missing mages; decipher and dismantle glyphs that attract Nameless while preserving the plants around them; calm or capture feral growth run amok; search charred clearings for relics lost by fallen expeditions; nurse wounded animal companions and use their instincts to guide your path; and mediate between mages whose powers over nature threaten to spiral out of control.

      Scour burned fields and collapsed guard towers to recover stolen artefacts and secure them against misuse; chase down traitors bearing veteran tattoos and inscriptions of Xaxos while deciphering whether they act alone or at someone’s behest; rally settlers at threatened outposts such as Southpost and defend them against armies of living brambles; guide plant‑based creatures back to peace when they are manipulated into violence; heal blighted soil after battles and replant with help from plant mages; and confront councils that conceal the truth, forcing hard choices between stability and transparency.
  5th Wave:
    setting: After Gravehold’s fall, mages venture to remote surface settlements and step through breaches into alien realms.  They visit sun‑drenched riverside villages like Azer, where glyph‑carved homes stand along a winding stream, and traverse the toxic Void with its jagged purple stones and impossible geometry.  On this journey they are accompanied by the wayward mage Xaxos, who serves as their bulwark.  Unlike Gravehold he can be charged to unleash unpredictable spells, and protecting him from harm is as vital as preserving any settlement.
    environment: Sunlit farms and river valleys; glyph‑marked houses and matching Tether tattoos; swirling voidscapes filled with floating rocks and poison fogs; windswept wastelands littered with skeletal remains; luminous caverns that conceal pools of gathered souls.
    mood: Hopeful yet tense—characters grapple with trust and redemption while exploring unfamiliar worlds and confronting corrupted heroes.  The tone shifts between the warmth of newfound communities and the cold alienness of the Void.
    themes: Trust and forgiveness, family bonds, balancing tradition with innovation, uniting disparate communities, confronting the consequences of tampering with forbidden power, and blending the worlds of humanity and the Void.
    special_rules: |
      In this wave Xaxos functions as a living stand‑in for Gravehold.  He has his own life total and can be damaged by nemesis attacks, so the expedition must protect him in order to succeed.  Unlike Gravehold he can accumulate charges; once charged he automatically casts spells from his own deck without player control.  Randomness governs which spells he unleashes, reflecting his unpredictable affinity with the Void.  Expeditions set in this wave should treat Xaxos as both an ally and a liability—charging him can provide bursts of power, but if he falls the expedition is lost.
    possible_expeditions: Defend a remote settlement against an unnatural experiment unleashed by unknown forces; join a rebel leader in seeking redemption while protecting survivors in distant villages; cross the toxic Void to harness pure aether and navigate its dangers; battle dream‑eating clouds and skeletal armies that threaten to overwhelm wandering mages; confront a fallen hero corrupted by the Void and decide whether to heed his warnings or see him as just another foe; explore a mysterious pool rumoured to collect the essence of fallen mages, choosing whether to destroy it or risk its temptation; rescue companions who have been partially transformed by forbidden power; and reconcile with the darkness by forging a new path between the world and the Void.
  6th Wave:
    setting: Generations later, New Gravehold faces its greatest crisis yet. The weight
      of past choices and hidden secrets threatens to collapse the city from within.
    environment: Darkened streets and partially collapsed towers in New Gravehold,
      interspersed with forgotten libraries and void-scarred wasteland.
    mood: Somber and desperate; the people feel betrayed by their leaders and must
      decide if their city can be saved.
    themes: Legacy, sacrifice, betrayal, the end of an era.
    possible_expeditions: Venturing into sealed archives to uncover truth, confronting
      traitorous mages, healing old wounds and preparing for a final stand against
      overwhelming forces.
  7th Wave:
    setting: A journey through time, exploring both the far past and a possible future
      of Gravehold. Mages travel across eras to prevent calamity.
    environment: Ancient citadels, lush pre-cataclysm forests, crumbling future ruins
      and shimmering time anomalies.
    mood: Mystical and urgent; time itself becomes an adversary as the consequences
      of actions ripple across eras.
    themes: Time travel, fate versus free will, preserving history, learning from
      mistakes.
    possible_expeditions: Seeking relics in forgotten temples, preventing paradoxes,
      guiding future generations, and repairing temporal rifts.
  8th Wave:
    setting: The world descends into the abyss. New Gravehold teeters on the edge
      of a chasm leading to the heart of the Void, and ancient tales come alive as
      the final battles approach.
    environment: Bottomless caverns, abyssal plains, and relic-filled tombs telling
      stories of old Gravehold. Void energies warp reality around them.
    mood: Foreboding and mythic; heroes feel the weight of centuries as they journey
      into darkness.
    themes: Descent, reckoning with ancient sins, the power of stories, and the struggle
      to find light in darkness.
    possible_expeditions: Venturing into the abyss to confront primordial entities,
      uncovering lost epics that inspire hope, and making the ultimate sacrifice to
      seal the Void.
