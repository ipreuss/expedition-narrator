  1st Wave:
    setting: |
      The world is still anchored in the caverns beneath Gravehold, a maze of tight passages, dripping stone, and ancient vaults lit by gemlight.  Mages and survivors push deeper into forgotten tunnels, discovering crystalline chambers, crumbling bridges, and hints of open sky where rare shafts of daylight filter down.  The wider society is cautious and insular, relying on small expeditions to map the depths, secure resources, and learn what was lost in ages past.
    mood: |
      The tone oscillates between tension and wonder.  Fear, fatigue and doubt gnaw at the mages as they descend, yet humour and camaraderie brighten their exchanges.  Moments of awe—discovering a cavern of amethyst, touching true daylight—are quickly shadowed by encounters with Nameless horrors.  Dreams turn sour, nightmares invade, and after the final battle the party wakes with blurred memories, underscoring how fragile hope and knowledge are in the face of the Void.
    themes: |
      Survival in oppressive darkness; trust and perseverance under pressure; exploration of forgotten places; the lure of knowledge versus the risk of forgetting; the interplay of companionship, curiosity and fear; and brief glimpses of the lost world above.
    possible_expeditions: |
      Chase strange tracks into unexplored depths; escort or follow a mysterious creature that knows secret ways; investigate ancient vaults carved by unknown builders; cross unstable bridges and chasms in search of daylight; and confront forces that threaten to steal memories or histories before they can be preserved.
  2nd Wave:
    setting: |
      A portion of the city has been pulled into the Void, leaving streets frozen in time and lives suspended between worlds.  Beyond an unseen threshold lies a surreal realm where ruins of civilisation merge with twisted rock and bone, rivers flow like oil, and monolithic stones hum with lost memories.  Time and gravity warp unpredictably, and the community must decide how far to reach into the Void to reclaim what was taken without being consumed by it.
    mood: |
      Haunted yet hopeful.  The survivors feel guilt over past failures and fear of what the Void might hold, yet loyalty and determination keep them moving.  Arguments flare and humour surfaces as they grapple with their own regrets.  Dreams, voices and memories intrude, and hours stretch into days as time warps around them.  Through it all, forgiveness and shared purpose temper despair, weaving a sense of found family.
    themes: |
      Redemption and loyalty; the strength of found family; confronting isolation and guilt; following faint calls through alien spaces; navigating distortions of time and reality; the pull between personal promises and the duty to protect one’s community; and the realization that even in the Void life and compassion endure.
    possible_expeditions: |
      Pursue echoing calls into warped pockets of the Void; investigate cities frozen in amber to free those trapped within; bargain with chanting cultists by a river of oil and blood; ascend the ribs of colossal skeletons to find pathways across the abyss; converse with monolithic stones that remember other worlds; and delve into distorted landscapes where time bends, seeking to rescue lost friends and reclaim pieces of their home.
  3rd Wave:
    setting: |
      Old Gravehold falls, and a new community is forged in the shadow of catastrophe.  Above, the ruined city smolders under a fractured sky and the remnants of breaches; below, survivors retreat into labyrinthine tunnels to train, heal, and rebuild.  The society that emerges is equal parts disciplined and fearful, guided by elders who urge caution and secrecy while younger mages struggle with grief, responsibility, and rumours of betrayal.
    mood: |
      Urgent and tragic at first, as mages scramble to save their home while the world crumbles around them.  Shock and grief set in as survivors realise that their city is gone and many friends and teachers are buried beneath the collapse.  Anger and blame flare—particularly toward those who sought forbidden power—but guilt and regret quickly give way to determination.  In the tunnels, the mood shifts toward resilience and camaraderie: elders counsel patience and forgetting, young mages train and support each other, and hope flickers as each wounded survivor is pulled from the rubble.  Throughout, there is an undercurrent of mistrust as whispers of betrayal surface and fear that the Nameless will return.
    themes: |
      Sacrifice and heroism in the face of overwhelming odds; the burden of leadership and the consequences of misuse of power; grief, guilt and forgiveness; surviving a catastrophe and forging a new community from its ruins; mentorship and the passing of knowledge under dire circumstances; the tension between remembering and forgetting; training novices to become defenders; protecting the helpless while confronting betrayal from within; and resilience amid the collapse of home.
    possible_expeditions: |
      Stand against waves of Nameless minions to give civilians time to escape; weave through burning streets to rescue trapped citizens or recover treasured relics; navigate collapsing caverns to find survivors and stabilise tunnels; escort wounded mages to safety while dodging debris and breaches; train novice mages in the dark, carving out space for them to practice safely; seek out fallen teachers or companions believed lost beneath the rubble; explore newly uncovered vaults for supplies and knowledge; confront re‑emerging minions led by a scarred lieutenant; quell outbreaks of panic and suspicion when signs of betrayal appear; and help transform underground chambers into a resilient new settlement while preparing for future threats; defend a fledgling settlement and train with veteran mentors to channel unique abilities; track fleeing minions or signs to discover verdant surface landscapes; harvest organic pods from a breeding ground and collaborate with a master craftsperson to forge specialized equipment; journey to locate other survivor groups and establish supply lines; rescue a captured leader from a mind‑controlling foe and close its breach; craft personalized spells and choose specializations with guidance from seasoned instructors; investigate poisonous fogs and other emerging breaches that threaten underground camps; battle through choking fogs to save the settlement; hold your ground against memory‑devouring creatures to secure rare resources; fortify mental defences with an anchor while retrieving potent ore; refine raw pulse energy into magical power; prepare for a final confrontation with a colossal foe by training and enhancing your abilities; and confront a former ally corrupted by forbidden power, deciding whether to redeem or defeat them while sealing the last breach.
  4th Wave:
    setting: |
      The survivors establish New Gravehold on the surface, building among ruins overtaken by forests, swamps, and open sky.  Society shifts toward settlement building, agriculture, and learning to live without constant breach magic, even as the wilderness teems with strange creatures and lingering Void energy.  Expeditions range outward through bogs, forests, and ancient ruins where glyphs, hidden bunkers, and forgotten forges hint at human hands shaping the land and its dangers.
    mood: |
      Hopeful yet cautious.  Building New Gravehold fills the survivors with a sense of purpose and renewal; life in the sun feels like a second chance.  The memory of their losses and Dezmodia’s sacrifice lingers, and the fear of another betrayal tempers their optimism.  As expeditions venture into swamps and forests to recover missing mages and relics, uneasy sensations of being watched and the presence of cultists loyal to fallen leaders sow mistrust.  Grief for fallen comrades and the weight of promised obligations mingle with wonder at the power still lurking in the earth.  Strange void artefacts and blighted landscapes evoke both dread and temptation as some mages question whether to wield dark energies for good.  Determination hardens into resolve—parties form not out of curiosity but necessity, driven by duty and the belief that the Nameless threat can be ended forever without repeating past mistakes.
      As crops fail and infection spreads, urgency replaces cautious optimism.  Panic, stubbornness and teasing erupt among young mages as they argue over how to respond.  The sight of colourful blooms sprouting around a mage’s feet offers fleeting hope against a backdrop of decay, while the discovery of glyphs that compel Nameless invites both relief and dread.  Uncontrolled growth triggered by fear may topple trees and entangle allies; reverence for plants clashes with the need to tear vines to free a friend.  Suspicions that a human hand is carving runes and manipulating flora sow mistrust.  The burden of controlling nature—and the fear of losing it entirely—presses the survivors onward even when exhaustion begs for rest.  Moments of camaraderie and jesting sit alongside grief and disillusionment when clues point to familiar insignias etched in the soil.  Hope flickers whenever animals guide the way or flowers bloom around a mage’s steps, reminding them of their bond with the land.
      The revelation that priceless artefacts have been stolen from the city and used as lures shakes the community’s trust in its own leaders.  Whispers of a traitor among the veteran mages and the sight of a tattoo reserved for elders on a fleeing saboteur create a sense of paranoia.  Anger flares when councils choose secrecy over truth, and younger mages question authority while pledging to expose corruption.  Grief deepens when family and home are called “carrion,” yet determination hardens as mages vow to cleanse the land, rescue those manipulated by traitors and rebuild a world where betrayal cannot take root.
    themes: |
      Rebirth from ruin; learning to trust and rebuild after catastrophe; the tension between abandoning magic and wielding it responsibly; leadership under scrutiny after betrayal; the hope of a world free from Nameless; confronting human cultists who would harness Void power; rescuing lost comrades and treasures; honouring the fallen through rituals and remembrance; confronting the temptation to use forbidden artefacts; dealing with unnatural aging and decay; surviving sudden climate shifts; and balancing mercy with vigilance in a land where corruption can fester in corpses and hearts alike.
      Hidden bunkers, secret forges and forgotten survivors; the rediscovery of lost mages and the bonds forged with them; the healing power of craft and creation amid ruin; and the importance of guiding those who have lost their memories back to the community.
      The tension between nurturing growth and halting decay; the ethics of luring enemies with powerful glyphs; learning to trust and rein in headstrong allies; finding balance between controlling natural forces and respecting their autonomy; and rescuing animal companions and their mages from blight and Void mutations.
      The mystery of who carves the glyphs that beckon Nameless and how far humans might go to harness their power; the conflict between reverence for living things and the necessity of destroying them to save loved ones; the temptation to hide painful truths from friends; and the challenge of reuniting family while confronting signs of betrayal carved in the soil.
      Traitors within one’s own ranks and the cost of secrecy; the line between protecting the community and deceiving it; the complexity of Nameless who are family to some and weapons to others; and the duty to hold leaders accountable even when doing so might cause chaos.  These themes underscore that the greatest threats can arise not only from the Void but also from those sworn to defend against it.
    possible_expeditions: |
      Track a missing expedition northward through swamps and wetlands to recover lost relics and comrades; confront splinter groups who use Nameless energy in hopes of “saving” the world; venture into bogs and forests to prevent insectoid creatures from encroaching on New Gravehold; burn corrupted remains to protect the soil and water; perform rituals for fallen heroes and retrieve precious artefacts from Nameless experiments; rescue aged survivors from blighted zones and restore their vitality; follow rumours of cultists carrying powerful artefacts deeper into unknown territory; investigate swirling breaches that leak temporal energies causing rapid aging; brave sudden blizzards conjured by void beasts; trace gigantic paw prints to uncover the lairs of unseen predators; unearth treasures buried by lost comrades beneath ancient trees; salvage void artefacts outlined in glowing runes and decide whether to destroy or purify them; and navigate moral dilemmas over whether to harness dark artefacts—all while weighing the risks of reawakening breach magic.
      Seek out hidden bunkers and forges beneath forests or swamps; rescue isolated survivors from these chambers and bring them back to New Gravehold; gather the weapons and tools scattered around secret workshops and decide whether to wield or retire them; rest after hard battles and listen for the sound of hollow ground that might conceal a trapdoor; and escort newfound allies home while fending off those who would exploit the Void’s power.
      Investigate blighted croplands and decaying forests; follow trails of thriving flowers to locate missing mages; decipher and dismantle glyphs that attract Nameless while preserving the plants around them; calm or capture feral growth run amok; search charred clearings for relics lost by fallen expeditions; nurse wounded animal companions and use their instincts to guide your path; and mediate between mages whose powers over nature threaten to spiral out of control.
      Explore willow groves where branches sway like guides; carve away vines to free imprisoned allies; track the creators of runic glyphs and stop their lures from draining aether; rescue captured mages from organic prisons and heal them from their draining wounds; retrieve brilliant artefacts perched on pedestals and decide whether to keep or destroy them; confront mutated flora that explode like living bombs; uncover clandestine human involvement in plant magic and address the moral dilemmas of alliances with Nameless; and confront monstrous armies that shake the earth while ensuring that headstrong companions remain safe.
      Scour burned fields and collapsed guard towers to recover stolen artefacts and secure them against misuse; chase down traitors bearing veteran tattoos and inscriptions of Xaxos while deciphering whether they act alone or at someone’s behest; rally settlers at threatened outposts such as Southpost and defend them against armies of living brambles; guide plant‑based creatures back to peace when they are manipulated into violence; heal blighted soil after battles and replant with help from plant mages; and confront councils that conceal the truth, forcing hard choices between stability and transparency.
  5th Wave:
    setting: |
      After the fall of Gravehold, mages venture to remote surface settlements and step through breaches into alien realms.  The world opens into sun‑drenched river valleys, glyph‑marked villages, and toxic voidscapes of jagged stone and impossible geometry.  Expeditions often rely on the unpredictable mage Xaxos as a bulwark, making protection of both people and tenuous alliances central to survival.
    mood: Hopeful yet tense—characters grapple with trust and redemption while exploring unfamiliar worlds and confronting corrupted heroes.  The tone shifts between the warmth of newfound communities and the cold alienness of the Void.
    themes: Trust and forgiveness, family bonds, balancing tradition with innovation, uniting disparate communities, confronting the consequences of tampering with forbidden power, and blending the worlds of humanity and the Void.
    special_rules: |
      In this wave Xaxos functions as a living stand‑in for Gravehold.  He has his own life total and can be damaged by nemesis attacks, so the expedition must protect him in order to succeed.  Unlike Gravehold he can accumulate charges; once charged he automatically casts spells from his own deck without player control.  Randomness governs which spells he unleashes, reflecting his unpredictable affinity with the Void.  Expeditions set in this wave should treat Xaxos as both an ally and a liability—charging him can provide bursts of power, but if he falls the expedition is lost.
    possible_expeditions: Defend a remote settlement against an unnatural experiment unleashed by unknown forces; join a rebel leader in seeking redemption while protecting survivors in distant villages; cross the toxic Void to harness pure aether and navigate its dangers; battle dream‑eating clouds and skeletal armies that threaten to overwhelm wandering mages; confront a fallen hero corrupted by the Void and decide whether to heed his warnings or see him as just another foe; explore a mysterious pool rumoured to collect the essence of fallen mages, choosing whether to destroy it or risk its temptation; rescue companions who have been partially transformed by forbidden power; and reconcile with the darkness by forging a new path between the world and the Void.
  6th Wave:
    setting: |
      New Gravehold stands on the surface, a city rebuilding under open skies with wooden halls and sunlit chambers.  The Hall of Elders serves as the seat of the Council, where veteran mages who once trained together now eye each other with suspicion.  A traitor lurks among the leadership, and the scars of past catastrophes—the Fall, the battle against Malevolence, the destruction of Southern Outpost—have left the community fractured.  Meanwhile, Xaxos and his followers have ventured deep into the Void, returning with forbidden knowledge and new mages who challenge the old ways.  Beyond New Gravehold lies Azer, a rival settlement whose inhabitants have chosen a different path—one that brings them into conflict with the Council's edicts.  Two philosophies clash: those who would seal themselves away from the Void forever, and those who believe humanity's salvation lies in understanding—and perhaps embracing—its power.
    mood: |
      Tense and fractured.  Political intrigue poisons the halls of power as elders who once trusted each other now guard secrets and suspicions.  Generational conflict simmers beneath the surface—younger mages question traditions while veterans cling to hard-won lessons.  Exile and betrayal hang in the air; old friendships shatter over irreconcilable philosophies.  Yet beneath the mistrust, a desperate hope persists: that somehow, whether through isolation or integration, humanity can find a path forward.  Grief for what was lost mingles with fear of what accepting the Void might cost.
    themes: |
      Trust and betrayal within leadership; generational conflict over how to confront the Void; exile and belonging; the tension between protecting the familiar and risking progress; whether to fight the Void or learn to coexist with it; accountability for past failures; the cost of rigid ideology when survival demands adaptation; and the rivalry between New Gravehold and Azer over humanity's future.
    possible_expeditions: |
      Investigate rumours of a traitor among the Council of Elders; escort exiled mages safely beyond New Gravehold's borders; journey into the Void alongside Xaxos to witness what he has discovered; defend New Gravehold against those who would exploit its internal divisions; mediate between factions before open conflict tears the city apart; travel to Azer to negotiate or confront its leaders; uncover the connections between the rival settlement and those who were banished from New Gravehold.
